        <h2 class="headline">Lab 14: Taking Photos</h2>

In this lab, you will take photos with differently colored backdrops. A professional looking photo will make your work look so much better when you put it on your website or project portfolio, so we hope this will be helpful for you. You will also learn how remove unwanted objects from your photo and in general improve the quality of your picture.<br><br>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

At the end of the lab, upload to your student google drive:
<ol>
	<li><code>5 photos</code> of your multi-touch pad: each photo should show the printed multi-touch pad, at least one finger touching the multi-touch pad, and either the signal visualization. blob detection, or your custom application on a screen), photos should have at least <code>two different backgrounds</code> (e.g. gray, red) and should be taken from <code>different angles</code>. Make sure your photos are cropped properly and no stuff is in the image that shouldn't be there.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="SETTINGUPBACKDROPS">(1) Setting up Backdrops</h3>

To get a nice homogeneous background, we use something that is called a <code>backdrop</code>. It is basically just a long roll of colored paper or PVC sheet that we can use as background.<br><br>

<b>Setting up Backdrops:</b> We already taped the backdrops to a wall in the class room. You can go ahead and place your multi-touch pad and laptop on it. We have backdrops both where the printers were previously setup as well as on the side where the laminators were.<br><br>

<b>Cardboard Backdrop vs. PCV:</b> Some of the photos in this tutorial are from this year and some from last year. You can easily spot this by looking at <code>how shiny or even the background</code> is. Last year we used <code>cardboard</code> as the backdrop, which is more even and less shiny than the <code>PVC</code> rolls we have this year. It's a different style and you may want to consider this in the future when you buy a backdrop for yourself.<br><br>

<h3 id="ARRANGINGHARDWAREONBACKDROP">(2) Arranging Laptop, Touchpad, and Breadboard on Backdrop</h3>

<b>Place Hardware on Backdrop:</b> The backdrops are not super wide, so it is important to place everything as tightly in the middle as possible. It is a good idea to put the <code>laptop in the background</code> and the <code>touchpad and breadboard in the foreground</code>.<br><br>

<b>Check Photo Edges:</b> Once you placed everything on the backdrop, check that when you take a photo with your <code>mobile phone</code> there is <code>no class room visible on the edges of the photo</code>. The left photo below is good but the right photo has the walls showing on the edges, which is not great. We recommend you find a compact layout for all your components before you move onto the next step.<br><br>

<h3 id="PREPAREPROCESSINGWINDOW">(3) Prepare Processing Window on Laptop Screen</h3>

Once you have your multi-touch placed on the backdrop, you still have to make sure it shows the Processing Window on your laptop. <br><br>

<b>What Data to Show in the Processing Window:</b> You can either show the <code>raw signal on the Serial Plotter (pset2/3)</code>, the <code>blob detection (pset4)</code>, or the <code>touch pressure visualization (pset5)</code>.<br><br>

<b>Either Use Screenshot or Live Program:</b> We recommend you try to take a photo of your <code>live data</code> since that will be more authentic. However, if that is too much work to get your touchpad to run again, you can also look through your previous pset submissions and put a <code>frame of the video</code> in the background. Just make sure that when you take the photo later that your finger positions match what you show on the laptop screen.

<br><br>

<h3 id="TAKINGPHOTOS">(4) Taking Photos</h3>

Now that you prepared everything, you are ready to actually take some photos.<br><br>

<b>Decide on Photo Perspective:</b> Below are some photos students took last year. It is worth taking a moment to think about <code>which perspective</code> one you like most and why. Which arrangement would you use for your touchpad? What would you change?<br><br>

<b>Take Photos:</b> Take some photos of your touch pad from different perspectives. Make sure you have <code>one or more fingers touching</code> and both your <code>multi-touch pad and breadboard are visible</code> and there is either the <code>signal processing, blob detection, or touch pressure visible on the laptop screen</code>.<br><br>

<b>Different Backdrops:</b> Take photos on at least <code>two different backdrops</code> to see the effect of different colors.<br><br>

<b>Take Photo with Edges Visible or Object in Photo:</b> Finally, take at least one <code>'ugly' photo</code> with the edges visible or some unwanted object in the image. We will show you in the next section of how to prettify such a photo with Photoshop.<br><br>

<h3 id="ALIGNINGANDCROPPING">(5) Aligning and Cropping your Photo</h3>

<b>Install Adobe Photoshop:</b> We recommend to use <a href="https://ist.mit.edu/adobe/cc">Adobe Photoshop. All MIT students have access to free Adobe Creative Cloud licenses here</a>. All our instructions will be based on Adobe Photoshop. If you use a different photo editing program that's fine but we may be less knowledgable on how to use it and may not be able to help you as much.<br><br>

<b>Video Tutorials:</b> For the next steps, we made <code>video tutorials</code> that guide you through some tools in Photoshop that are helpful in making a photo look better. The video quality might be better if you click on the YouTube icon in the lower left corner, which opens a new tab and you can <code>set the quality to 1080p</code>.<br><br>

First, we will show you how you can properly <code>align and crop your photo</code>. You can see an example below where the laptop was originally very tilted in the image and we corrected it to be more horizontal.<br><br>

<b>Short Cuts:</b><br>

zooming: option + scroll<br>
ruler: command + R to activate ruler toolbar, then drag the ruler line from the ruler bar<br>
rotate image: go to top menu bar -> image -> image rotation -> arbitrary, then enter your rotation angle<br>
crop: press 'c', drag the edges until happy, then double click on image to activate crop<br>
save: command + 's' or go to menu File -> save as<br><br>

<h3 id="REMOVINGOBJECTS">(5) Cleaning up the Edges and Removing Unwanted Objects</h3>

Next, we will show you how to <code>clean up the edges</code> in case you see a bit of wall in your photo and how to <code>remove unwanted objects</code> in your photo. Below you can see an example where we both replaced the wall segments on the left and right side of the photo as well as removed the cable that was sticking out on the left side of the laptop screen.<br><br>

<b>Short Cuts:</b><br>

In this lab series, you will create presentation materials for your multi-touch pad. You will create a rotoscope by drawing on top of a photo, take photos with a backdrop, create a short video of your multi-touch pad and then add all the materials to a website.<br><br>
