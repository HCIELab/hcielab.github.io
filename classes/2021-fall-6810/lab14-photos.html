<h2 class="headline">How to Take a Photo with a Clean Background</h2>

A professional looking photo will make your work look so much better when you put it on your website or project portfolio.<br>
Please don't underestimate how important professional presentation is.<br>
Recruiters have only a few minutes or less to do a skim over the first round of applications, and having a high quality presentation of your work is super valuable at this point.<br>
<br>

The tutorial below will show images from the old multitouch pad that we made in class in previous years but the steps are the same. The old multi-touch pad was based on FTIR (light bouncing inside of acrylic to find touch points) but we upgraded this to capacitive touch pads this year since that's what's actually used in consumer hardware.<br><br>

<h3>Backdrops</h3>

To be able to get a nice homogeneous background, we use something that is called a backdrop.<br>
It is basically just a long roll of colored paper that we tape to the wall and then place whatever we want to take a photo of on it.<br><br>

Here is how the setup looks like.<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/backdrop1.jpg" width="643px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

You can buy backdrops in many different stores.<br>
We bought most of our backdrops here from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ER2YQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1">amazon (Savage Seamless Background Paper - # Super White, #32 Light Gray (53" x 36'), or Black)</a>.<br>
They cost about $50 per roll, and a roll lasts forever.<br>
<br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/backdrop7.jpg" width="543px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

We already set up a few tables at the IDC, so you can just come in and use the backdrops we already set up on the tables.<br>
In case there is not enough space available, you can also create a new backdrop setup by simply cutting off a piece from the roll that is long enough to cover your photo area.<br>
Remember, it's just cardboard, so it's not a huge deal if you need to cut one more piece.<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/backdrop8.jpg" width="543px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

<h3>Taking the Photos</h3>
<br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/backdrop2.jpg" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/backdrop3.jpg" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/backdrop5.jpg" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/backdrop4.jpg" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

These are some images I snapped with my iPhone in my office using the setup you see above.<br>
It is worth taking a moment to think about which one you like most and why.<br>
For instance, some images have the laptop further back and the touchpad in the front, some have it reversed. <br>
Which arrangement would you use for your touchpad?<br><br>



<h3>Deliverables</h3>

<h2 class="headline">Removing Things from an Image That Should not be There</h2>


<h3>Step 4: Removing stuff from an image that should not be there</h3>

Sometimes the photo doesn't come out super nice for various reasons, then photo-editing, with Photoshop or Gimp comes in very handy.<br>

For instance, here we just forget to pay close attention when taking a picture and there is stuff that should not have been there. Two examples below.
<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/editing1.jpg" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/editing2.jpg" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

In the left image I forgot to remove my breakfast Knoppers (german chocolate waffle) from the backdrop... In the second image the backdrop wasn't long enough on one side, which looks unprofessional.<br><br>

How can we fix this without retaking the picture?<br>
We show you a walkthrough for both Photoshop and Gimp below.<br><br>

<span style="color:red">Before you ever photoshop an image, consider if it is morally ok to do so. For instance, it is totally ok to remove the waffle in the first image and to fix the background problem in the second image, but it would NOT BE OKAY to remove engineering mistakes from your prototype or even worse add functionality that was never there.</span>
<br><br>

Ok, with this in mind, let's get started.

<br><br>
<h4 style="color:red">I will show you how to do it at the example of my picture. Please take your own picture now, put a small object in the image right next to your own touchpad that you want to remove later, such as a pen, coffee cup, a piece of tape. Avoid any overlaps with existing objects since this will be harder to remove.</h4>
<br><br>

<b>In Photoshop</b><br><br>

Open your own image, mine looks like this:
<br><br>
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/clone-stamp0.png" width="543px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

Select the 'Clone Stamp Tool' from the Tool menu.<br>
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/clone-stamp1.png" width="143px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/clone-stamp2.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

You can follow my instructions below or watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7jf6MCVvmk">short video here on how to use the clone stamp tool</a>.<br>
With the clone stamp tool selected, press Alt + click somewhere on the black background.<br>
This will 'copy' that area using the center of your click as the reference point.<br>
Now click on the objecty ou want to remove, this should start making it black.<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/clone-stamp3.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

It is best practice to not drag and 'paint out' the area.<br>
It is better to repeatedly Alt+click somewhere to copy that area, and then click again on the object you want to remove to stamp there, so you sample from multiple areas.<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/clone-stamp4.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/clone-stamp5.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

Ok, so that's not bad but it's clearly visible that something in the image was modified.<br>
To blur this a bit more, use the 'patch' tool from the toolbar.<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/clone-stamp6.png" width="243px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

Using the patch tool, draw a selection around your stamped area.<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/clone-stamp7.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>
Now drag that area over another black area, both will be mixed together.<br>
Make sure _not_ to hit the laptop or a part of the touchpad, so this here is bad:<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/clone-stamp8.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

Repeat this a couple of times for better sampling results. 
<br><br>
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/clone-stamp9.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>
Done!
<br><br>

<br><br>


<b>In Gimp (free for download)</b><br><br>

You can <a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/">download Gimp from here.</a>
<br><br>

Open your own image, mine looks like this:
<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/gimp0.png" width="543px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

Select the 'Clone Tool' from the Tool menu.<br>
I describe how to use it below, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axFwQfiGmaU">but you can also watch this short 1 min video.</a><br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/gimp1.png" width="143px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

Press command (on mac) or control (on windows) and click somewhere on the black background.<br>
This will 'copy' that area using the center of your click as the reference point.<br>
Now click on the objecty ou want to remove, this should start making it black.<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/gimp2.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/gimp3.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

It is best practice to not drag and 'paint out' the area.<br>
It is better to repeatedly Alt+click somewhere to copy that area, and then click again on the object you want to remove to stamp there, so you sample from multiple areas.<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/gimp4.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/gimp5.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/gimp7.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

Ok, so that's not bad but it's clearly visible that something in the image was modified.<br>
To blur this a bit more, use the 'Healing Tool' from the toolbar.<br><br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/gimp8.png" width="243px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

The healing tool works in the same way as the clone tool.<br>
Press command (on mac) or control (on windows) and click somewhere on the black background (_not_ your stamped area where you removed the object).<br>
This will 'copy' that area using the center of your click as the reference point.<br>
Now click on your stamped area and paint a bit around, this should smooth things out.<br><br>
 <br>

<img src="images/viz-photo-editing/gimp9.png" width="343px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

Repeat this a couple of times for better sampling results. 
<br><br>
