        <h2 class="headline">Pset1: User Interface for Multi-Touch Pad Fabrication Files</h2>


In this problem set, you will write a user interface in Processing that will automatically generate the fabrication files for making multi-touch pads of different dimensions (e.g., 8x4 electrodes or 4x6 electrodes). A user will be able to input parameters, such as the number of electrodes for the rows and columns of the multi-touch pad and then automatically receive the matching fabrication files, i.e. 2D drawings of the electrode layouts in .pdf file format that the user can then send to their 2D printer for conductive inkjet printing. You will implement this interface in Processing.<br><br>

For the multi-touch pad, we will be using the classical two-layered diamond pattern that is commonly used for mutual-capacitive touch sensing.
As explained in lecture, this means that your multi-touch pad has two electrode layers that are printed separately: One layer contains the rows, the other layer contains the columns.
Each row/column consists of multiple electrodes and has a single wire at the end.
Once both sheets are printed, you layer them on top of each other to build the multi-touch pad.<br><br>

<b>Steps:</b>
<ol>
	<li>Create input fields for multi-touch dimensions in x/y via Processing</li>
	<li>Draw electrodes via Processing</li>
	<li>Drawing the Wires via Processing</li>
	<li>Adjust the number of electrodes via the input fields</li>
	<li>Write a Preview & Export Function for the Fabrication Files</li>
	<li>Check that your drawing has the correct size when printed out</li>
</ol>

<h3>(1) Create Input Fields for Multi-Touch Dimensions</h3>

In the user interface, create two input fields that allow the user to set the desired number of electrodes for the 'columns' and 'rows' (default value should be 10 electrodes). A simple trick to create UI elements in Processing is to draw a rectangle and then check if a mouse-click event occured over the rectangle to transfrom it into a button. A text label overlaid on the rectangle can be used to display the current value. You can check the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/rect_.html">Rect</a> and <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/text/">Text and Fonts</a> Tutorial for more information. Make sure the user cannot enter negative values. The upper bound for the number of electrodes that fit onto one sheet is <span style="color:red">20 electrodes</span> and thus the user should not be allowed to exceed this number.<br><br> 

<img src="images/pset1/user-interface-inputs.png" width="300px"><br><br>


<h3>(2) Drawing the Electrodes and Wires</h3>

<b>Drawing one electrode:</b> Next, draw one electrode. An electrode is a rectangle rotated by 45 degrees. For now, don't worry about the exact size. To draw the electrode, you should use a <a href="https://processing.org/reference/PGraphics.html">PGraphics</a> canvas and then draw a <a href="https://processing.org/reference/PImage.html">PImage</a> onto it. <br><br>

<b>Drawing multiple electrodes & Connecting to UI input:</b> Once you can draw one electrode, create a second electrode at an offset either horizontally to start forming a row or vertically to start forming a column. For now, don't worry about the exact number for the offset. Next, connect the number of electrodes to your user interface input elements, i.e. when the user sets the number of electrodes for the columns to be '10' and rows to be '6' your screen should draw ten electrodes vertically and 6 electrodes horizontally.<br><br>

<b>Drawing Wires:</b> Next, draw the wires that connect the electrodes. For now don't worry about the exact thickness. At the end of each row/column, the wire is routed to the side to  connect to an FPC connector. For now, don't worry about the exact spacing on the FPC connector. <br><br>

<h3>(4) Preview Function to Look at Each Layer Individually</h3>

For the preview function, create one button that switches between the design's top and bottom layer view. Clicking the button should either show the top layer or the bottom layer so the layers can be looked at individually.<br><br>

<img src="images/pset1/switch-view.png" width="700px"><br><br>

<h3>(5) Export Function to Save Fabrication Files</h3>

For export, create one button that when clicked saves the generated electrodes into two .pdf files. The bottom-electrodes.pdf should contain the rows, and the top-electrodes.pdf should contain the columns. Make sure the exported .pdf files have all settings correctly set for conductive inkjet printing <a href="lab1-circuit-design-for-inkjet-printing.html">(if you don't remember, go back to Lab1).</a>

Other parameters that you need to set in your code but don't have to display in the UI, are: <br>
<!--  for the design (you don't have to display them in the UI, but please do think of good reasons for them, you can start from <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/FAQs%20-%20Sensor%20Design%20Guidelines.pdf">here</a>): <br> -->
<ul> 
	<li>the edge length of the electrodes (diamond shape) in mm (default value: 6mm)</li>
	<li>the spacing between adjacent electrodes in mm (default value: 1mm)</li>
	<li>the spacing between non-connected electrodes, i.e. rows and columns, in mm (default value: 1mm)</li>
	<li>the thickness of the wires inside of multi-touch pad that connect electrodes, in mm (default value: 0.3mm)</li>
	<li>the thickness of the wires outside of multi-touch pad that connect to FPC connectors, in mm (default value: 0.5mm)</li>
	<li>the spacing of wires on the FPC connector in mm (we are using the 1mm in FPC spacing, notice that the board has two sides and could also be used for 0.5mm if the 0.5mm connector was soldered on the other side. For more details, please look at the data sheet of the FPC connector <a href="https://datasheet.octopart.com/FH12-10%284%29SA-1SH%2855%29-Hirose-datasheet-8324494.pdf">here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<b>Setting the Processing window to the right resolution for printing</b><br>
Since the multi-touch pad design is printed in <b>millimeter</b> but Processing handles everything in <b>pixel</b>, you first need to figure out a conversion factor between pixel and millimeter to determine the Processing window size. <br><br>

Note that Processing uses a fixed dots per inch measurement.<br>
On <b>Windows,</b> you are most likely to encounter a 96 dpi resolution.<br>
On <b>Mac,</b> you are also most likely to encounter a 96dpi resolution but it may also be 72dpi. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">Wikipedia</a> thinks it is 72dpi, however, according to our own tests on Mac, it was 96dpi, i.e. the same as on Windows.<br>
(Note that the resolution of the Processing sketch window is different from the screen resolution pixel per inch, which usually are around a couple hundred nowadays, this is set by the operating system and mainly used for programs heavy on typography like Microsoft Word).<br><br>

If you are unsure about the right resolution, you can do the following test:<br>
Create a window in Processing of any size and draw a rectangle into the window using a fixed pixel size (e.g. rect(96,96) = 96 x 96 pixels).<br>
Export the square using your implemented .pdf export function and print it out with a normal inkjet printer. While printing make sure you don't scale the image and instead print it with the <b>"Print Entire Image"</b> setting which keeps it at its exported size.<br>
Next, measure the output with a ruler and determine how many inch it is (e.g., let's say it was 1 inch). <br>
Finally, you can calcuate Processing's dpi by calculating the pixel to inch conversion factor based on this, which in our case is 96dots/1 inch = 96dpi.<br>
Since our inputs are in mm, you still need to convert the dpi to dots per mm. For this, simply divide by how many millimeters are one inch (1 inch = 25.4mm). Thus, we will have 96dpi / 25.4mm = 3.78 dots per mm.<br>
So if you draw a rectangle of 100 pixel it will be 100pixel / 3.78 dots per mm = 26.46mm.<br><br>

<b>Testing your Program</b><br>

When you are done, make sure you test your user interface by exporting several different multi-touch pad sizes, e.g. 4x10, 12x6, 5x5.
If you are unsure if everything has the right dimension, use a regular color printer to print out your design and measure it with a ruler.<br>

<h3>Upload your Code and Design Files, Show Hardware to TA</h3>

For grading, please upload the following to your google drive student folder:<br>

<ul>
	<li>the .pde file of your Processing program</li>
	<li>the two .pdf files you used for conductive inkjet printing</li>
	<li>3-5 photos showing your assembled circuit from different perspectives (include top view + side views)</li>
	<!-- <li><span style="color:red">bring your assembled multi-touch pad to your spray session</span></li> -->
</ul>


<h3>Grading</h3>

We will give 25 pts in total:
<ul>
	<li>does the Processing UI have input elements that correctly set the number of electrodes in x-direction, the number of electrodes in y-direction, and the edge length of the electrodes, or are these values hardcoded in the code? (5 pts)</li>
	<li>does the Processing UI have lower and upper bounds for each input field? are the selected lower and upper bounds well reasoned based on what makes sense given the hardware parts you have available for the pset, the sensing principle we use, and given that a human is touching the multi-touch pad? (5 pts)</li>
	<li>does the Processing UI export function export a drawing in the correct dimensions into two seperate .pdf files that are named correctly and that have the correct settings for conductive inkjet printing? are the toggle functions for showing/hiding layers implemented? (5 pts)</li>
	<li>did you finish assembling your multi-touch pad, i.e. did you inkjet print both the top and bottom electrode layer, glued them together, and connected the FPC chips? (5 pts)</li>
	<li>did you correctly build the multi-touch sensing circuit using the multiplexer, resistors and ESP? (5 pts)</li>
</ul>
