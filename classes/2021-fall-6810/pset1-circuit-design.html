        <h2 class="headline">Pset1: User Interface for Multi-Touch Pad Fabrication Files</h2>


In this problem set, you will create a user interface that will automatically generate the fabrication files for making multi-touch pads of different dimensions (e.g., 8x4 electrodes or 4x6 electrodes). A user will be able to input parameters, such as the number of electrodes for the rows and columns of the multi-touch pad and then automatically receive the matching fabrication files, i.e. 2D drawings of the electrode layouts in .pdf file format that the user can then send to their 2D printer for conductive inkjet printing. You will implement this interface in Processing.<br><br>

For the multi-touch pad, we will use the classical two-layered diamond pattern that is commonly used for mutual-capacitive touch sensing.
As explained in lecture, this means that your multi-touch pad has two electrode layers, printed separately: One layer contains the rows, the other contains the columns.
Each row/column consists of multiple electrodes and has a single wire at the end.
Once both sheets are printed, you will layer them on top of each other to build the multi-touch pad.<br><br>

</ol>

<h3 id="INPUT">(1) Create Input Fields for the Number of Electrodes</h3>

In the user interface, create two input fields that allow the user to set the desired number of electrodes for the 'rows' and 'columns' (default value should be 10 electrodes for both). A simple trick to creating UI elements in Processing is to first draw a rectangle; then, you can check if a mouse-click event occured over the rectangle to create a button, or you can overlay a text label on the rectangle to display the current value. Refer to the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/rect_.html" target="_blank">Rect</a> and <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/text/" target="_blank">Text and Fonts</a> tutorials for more information. Make sure the user cannot enter negative values. The upper bound for the number of electrodes that fit on one sheet is 12 electrodes and thus the user should not be allowed to exceed this number.<br><br> 

<img src="images/pset1/user-interface-inputs-new.png" width="370px" style="cursor:pointer;"><br><br>

In the skeleton code, put your code for creating the input fields in the <code>createUI()</code> function:

<pre>
	<code class="language-processing">
		void createUI() {
		}
	</code>
</pre>
<br>

<h3 id="DRAW">(2) Drawing the Electrodes and Wires</h3>

<img src="images/pset1/drawing-electrodes-wires-new.png" width="370px" style="cursor:pointer;"><br><br>

<b>Drawing one electrode:</b> Next, draw one electrode. An electrode is a rectangle rotated by 45 degrees.
Use the variable <code>electrodeSize</code> from the pset1_header.pde file for the size of the electrode.<br>

<pre>
	<code class="language-processing">
		float electrodeSize = 6*mm;		// A side length of an electrode: 6 mm in pixels
	</code>
</pre>

<br>

In the skeleton code, put your code for drawing one electrode in the <code>drawSingleElectrode()</code> function:

<pre>
	<code class="language-processing">
		void drawSingleElectrode(float _x, float _y, float _sideLength){
		}
	</code>
</pre>

<br>

<!-- For now, don't worry about the exact size. To draw the electrode, you should use a <a href="https://processing.org/reference/PGraphics.html">PGraphics</a> canvas and then draw a <a href="https://processing.org/reference/PImage.html">PImage</a> onto it. -->

<b>Drawing multiple electrodes:</b> Once you can draw one electrode, create a second electrode at an offset either horizontally to start forming a row, or vertically to start forming a column.
Use the variable <code>electrodeOffset</code> from the pset1_header.pde file for the offset.
<br>
<!-- For now, don't worry about the exact number for the offset. -->

<pre>
	<code class="language-processing">
		float electrodeOffset = 1*mm;	// An offset between electrodes: 1 mm in pixels
	</code>
</pre>

<br>

In the skeleton code, put your code for drawing multiple electrodes in the <code>drawElectrodes()</code> function:

<pre>
	<code class="language-processing">
		void drawElectrodes(int _row, int _col, int _init_x, int _init_y) {
			// (call 2a) Call drawSingleElectrode() function iteratvily to draw multiple electrodes
			drawSingleElectrode(_init_x, _init_y, electrodeSize);  // "electrodeSize" is defined in the pset1_header file.
		}
	</code>
</pre>

<b> Translate UI input into electrode count:</b> Next, translate the UI input into the correct number of eletrodes generated by your functions, i.e. when the user sets the number of electrodes for the columns to be '10' and the rows to be '6', your program should draw a grid with 10 electrodes vertically and 6 electrodes horizontally.<br><br>

<b>Drawing Wires:</b> Next, draw the wires that connect the electrodes.
Use the variables <code>wireThicknessInside</code> and <code>wireThicknessOutside</code> from the pset1_header.pde file for the thickness of the wires.<br>

<pre>
	<code class="language-processing">
		float wireThicknessInside = 0.3*mm;		// the thickness of the wires inside of multi-touch pad that connect electrodes, in mm (default value: 0.3mm)
		float wireThicknessOutside = 0.5*mm;	// the thickness of the wires outside of multi-touch pad that connect to FPC connectors, in mm (default value: 0.5mm)
	</code>
</pre>

<br>

At the end of each row/column, the wire is routed to the side to connect to an FPC connector.
Use the variable, <code>spacing</code>, in the pset1_header.pde file for the spacing on the FPC connector.
<br>
<pre>
	<code class="language-processing">
		float spacing = 0.5*mm;	// the spacing of wires on the FPC connector in mm
	</code>
</pre>

<br>

In the skeleton code, put your code for drawing wires in the <code>drawWires()</code> function:

<pre>
	<code class="language-processing">
		void drawWires(float _spacing, float _thicknessInside, float _thicknessOutside) {
		}
	</code>
</pre>

<h3 id="PREVIEW">(3) Preview Function to Look at Each Layer Individually</h3>

<b>Top and Bottom Layer of Multi-touch Pad:</b> The multi-touch pad consists of two layers; a bottom layer and a top layer. If the bottom layer has x rows and y columns of electrodes, the top layer should have y rows and x columns of electrodes. Thus you can draw two layers at once by swapping the row and column variables that the user entered.
<br><br>

<b>Create 'Switch Views' Button:</b> Create a button that switches between the design's top and bottom layer view. That way, clicking the button should either show the top layer or the bottom layer so the layers can be looked at individually.<br><br>

<img src="images/pset1/switch_view_note.png" width="900px" style="cursor:pointer;"><br><br>

In the skeleton code, put your code for switching views between the design's top and bottom layer in the <code>switchView()</code> function:

<pre>
	<code class="language-processing">
		public void switchView() {
		}
	</code>
</pre>

<br>

<h3 id="EXPORT">(4) Export Function to Save Fabrication Files</h3>

<b>Create 'Save Views' Button:</b> Add a button that, when clicked, saves the generated electrode layers into two .pdf files. The bottom-electrodes.pdf should contain the rows, and the top-electrodes.pdf should contain the columns. <br><br>

<!--<b>Ensure Correct Drawing Settings:</b> Make sure the exported .pdf files have all settings correctly set for conductive inkjet printing <span style="color:red">what does this mean? does this mean that the electrodes should be made full black etc? I don't think we have that requirement anymore so we can probably take this out.</span><a href="lab1-circuit-design-for-inkjet-printing.html">(if you don't remember, go back to Lab1).</a> 
<br><br>-->

<img src="images/pset1/switch_view_01.png" width="370px" style="cursor:pointer;"> <img src="images/pset1/switch_view_02.png" width="370px" style="cursor:pointer;"><br><br>

In the skeleton code, put your code for saving fabrication files in the <code>saveViews()</code> function:

<pre>
	<code class="language-processing">
		public void saveViews() {
		}
	</code>
</pre>

<br>

<h3 id="CHECK">(5) Finding Your DPI to Convert Pixel to mm</h3>

Our multi-touch pad design is printed in <b>millimeters</b> but Processing handles everything in <b>pixels</b>. How do we know the number of pixels in one millimeter? Without this conversion factor, we won't know how many pixels we should use for the electrodes lengths, wire thicknesses, and the spacing/offsets between these components. The conversion factor from pixel to mm is different for each operating system. We will thus do a test to figure this out for your specific OS. <br><br>

<b>Determing DPI:</b> Create a new document in Illustrator. Set the drawing unit to 'millimeters' (File -> Document Setup -> Units 'Milimeters'). <br><br>

<img src="images/pset1/02_document_setup_mm.gif" width="800px" style="cursor:pointer;">
<br><br>

Then draw an 1 mm line with the pen tool. You can set line width to 1 mm and height to 0 mm in the property window. <br><br>
<img src="images/pset1/03_draw_line_with_pen_tool.gif" width="800px" style="cursor:pointer;">
<br><br>

Change the drawing unit to 'pixels' (File -> Document Setup -> Units 'Pixels'). Then select the line to see the line length in the property panel in pixels. <br><br>
<img src="images/pset1/04_document_setup_pixel.gif" width="800px" style="cursor:pointer;">
<br><br>

Now you know that 1 mm is the same as 2.835 pixels. <br><br>

<b>Confirming dpi:</b> To confirm that this is indeed the correct DPI for your OS, go back to Processing, and use the code below to draw a line of 2.835 pixels, which should correspond to 1mm.

<pre>
	<code class="language-processing">
		void drawLine() {
			background(255);
			int offset = 100;
			<span style="color:red">float line_length = 2.835;</span>
			line(offset,offset,offset+line_length,offset);
			stroke(204, 102, 0);
		}
	</code>
</pre>
<br>

Export the line using your implemented .pdf export function, and open it in Adobe Illustrator. Don't forget to set the document units to 'milimeters'. Then select the line. Do you now see 1 mm? If yes, you can now be confident that 1mm is 2.835 pixels for your OS.<br><br>
<img src="images/pset1/05_test_dpi.gif" width="800px" style="cursor:pointer;">
<br><br>

<!-- For starters, let's assume a 96dpi conversion factor, i.e. 96 dots (pixel) fit into 1 inch (25.4mm). To find out if this is correct for your OS, create a rectangle in Processing that is 96x96 pixel wide (rect(96,96)). Export the rectangle using your implemented .pdf export function and open it in Adobe Illustrator. 

In Adobe Illustrator, make sure the drawing is set to 'inch' not 'points' (File -> Document Setup -> Units 'inches'). Then click the rectangle and in the 'properties' window (Window -> Properties), check the 'width' (e.g., '0.8 inch'). You now know that 96 pixels are a certain number of inch, i.e. in our case 0.8 inch. You can do the math 96dots/0.8 inch = 120dpi.<br><br>

<b>Confirming dpi:</b> To confirm that this is indeed the correct dpi for your OS, go back to Processing, draw a new rectangle of 120x120 pixel (rect(120,120), export again as pdf, and reopen in Illustrator. Don't forget to set the document units again to 'inches'. Then check the width of the rectangle. Do you now see 1 inch? If yes, you can now be confident that your OS has 120dpi.<br><br>

<b>Pixel to mm:</b> Since our inputs are in mm not in inch, you still need to convert the dpi to dots per mm. For this, simply divide by how many millimeters are one inch (1 inch = 25.4mm). Thus, we will have, e.g. 120dpi / 25.4mm = 4.72 pixel per mm.<br><br>

<h3 id="DPISCALEFACTOR">(6) Adjust Multi-Touch Pad Dimensions Using DPI Scale Factor</h3>

Now that you have your DPI scale factor, it's time to update all the multi-touch elements to have the right size.<br><br> 

<!--<span style="color:red">is this already in the code? do I need to do something here?</span>-->
<b>Applying Scaling Factor to Electrodes:</b> So, if our electrodes are 6mm in size, they will be around 6 * 2.835 = 17.01 pixels wide.<br><br>

You need to <b>find pixels per mm of your system</b>, which can be different from 2.835.<br><br>
<!--<span style="color:red">Say that variable mm needs to be set to your 2.835 factor</span>-->

<!-- Other parameters that you need to set in your code but don't have to display in the UI, are: <br> -->
<!--  for the design (you don't have to display them in the UI, but please do think of good reasons for them, you can start from <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/FAQs%20-%20Sensor%20Design%20Guidelines.pdf">here</a>): <br> -->

<!-- <span style="color:red">is this already in the code? do I need to do something here?</span>
<ul> 
	<li>the edge length of the electrodes (diamond shape) in mm (default value: 6mm)</li>
	<li>the spacing between adjacent electrodes in mm (default value: 1mm)</li>
	<li>the spacing between non-connected electrodes, i.e. rows and columns, in mm (default value: 1mm)</li>
	<li>the thickness of the wires inside of multi-touch pad that connect electrodes, in mm (default value: 0.3mm)</li>

<h3 id="EXPORTPDFS">(7) Export Multi-touch Pad</h3>

When you are done with your code, export a multi-touch pad design of <code>8x9 electrodes</code> from your user interface.<br><br>

<h3 id="DOUBLECHECK">(8) Final Check before you Submit</h3>

Before you submit files, please check the following: <br><br>

<b>Two PDF Files:</b> You should have 2 pdf files: bottom-electrodes.pdf and top-electrodes.pdf.<br><br>

<b>Check Alignment of both Top/Bottom Layers:</b> Open both PDF files in Illustrator and overlay them on top of each other to check that the columns and rows of the multi-touch pad are correctly positioned.<br><br>

<b>Check Dimensions:</b> Open each .pdf file in Illustrator and measure the length of each element to confirm that it has the right size. Below is a short video of how to measure an element in Illustrator.
		<ul>
			<li>edge length of the electrodes: 6mm</li>
			<li>spacing between adjacent electrodes: 1mm</li>
			<li>spacing between non-connected electrodes: 1mm</li>
			<li>thickness of wires inside of multi-touch pad that connect electrodes: 0.3mm <span style="color:red">the image above from DuoSkin is confusing, it shows this for an outside wire</span></li>
			<li>thickness of the wires outside of multi-touch pad that connect to FPC connectors: 0.5mm</li>
			<li>spacing of wires on the FPC connector: 0.5mm</li>
		</ul><br>

<!-- Note that Processing uses a fixed dots per inch measurement.<br>
On <b>Windows,</b> you are most likely to encounter a 96 dpi resolution.<br>
On <b>Mac,</b> you are also most likely to encounter a 96dpi resolution but it may also be 72dpi. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">Wikipedia</a> thinks it is 72dpi, however, according to our own tests on Mac, it was 96dpi, i.e. the same as on Windows.<br>
(Note that the resolution of the Processing sketch window is different from the screen resolution pixel per inch, which usually are around a couple hundred nowadays, this is set by the operating system and mainly used for programs heavy on typography like Microsoft Word).<br><br> -->

In this pset series, you will create an inkjet printed multi-touch pad. You will first write a Processing program that automatically generates the fabrication files for the multi-touch pad. Next, you will print your multi-touch pad, assemble it, and then build the circuit for sensing touch input. You will then write the microcontroller code for reading the touch signals from each electrode. Next, you will extend your code to draw the touch signals onto an image and then extract the touch points via computer vision. Finally, you will write a gesture recognizer that can differentiate between different user inputs.<br><br>
