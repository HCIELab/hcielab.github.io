     <h3 id="XX">(1) Understand Temperature Sensing</h3>

     You will make your own temperature from scratch using conductive inkjet printing. But why can conductive traces be used to sense temperature?<br><br>

     <b>Thermal Resistivity (Resistance Changes with Temperature):</b> Conductive wires can be used to sense temperature by making use of a material property that most conductive metals share: Their resistance changes with changes in temperature. This property is called <i>thermal resistivity p</i>.<br><br>

     <b>Formula for Computing Overall Resistance based on Thermal Resistivity:</b> The formula for determining the overall resistance of a wire based on thermal resistivity, length of a wire, and thickness of a wire (cross section) is shown in the picture below. As you can see, given a wire with a fixed length l and a fixed cross section A, the higher the thermal resistivity (i.e. the resistance introduced by changes in heat) the higher the overall resistance. (Note that we use wire thickness instead of cross section, we discard height since all wires have the same height)<br><br> 

     <b>Thermal Resistivity for Silver Used in Conductive Inkjet Printing:</b> For silver, the thermal resistivity p increases with increases in temperature. Thus, the higher the temperature, the higher the thermal resistivity and the higher the overall resistance of our wire. Thus, by reading the overall resistance of the wire with our microcontroller, we can determine the mug's temperature.<br><br> 

    <img src="images/lab6/resistance.png" width="400px"><br><br>

    <h3 id="XX">(2) Choose Overall Resistance (R)</h3>

    As you can see in the formula above, the only part that is given is the thermal resistivity (p) for our material silver, which is determined by nature. However, we can freely choose the overall resistance (R), the wire length (l) and the thickness of the wire (A). Let's first determine what overall resistance (R) would be good to use.<br><br> 

    <b>Effect of Overall Resistance (R) on Temperature Sensor Resolution:</b> The higher the overall resistance of the conductive wire, the more sensitive it will be to temperature changes. Consider the following example: If your wire has a small resistance (50Ohm) and the resistance changes a little bit (5%), the change will be very small (5% of 50Ohm = 2.5Ohm). This is difficult to measure since there is always noise in electronics. In contrast, if your wire has a large resistance (1kOhm), the change will be larger (5% of 1,000 Ohm = 50Ohm), which is easier to measure. Thus, a wire with a larger resistance allows you to measure smaller changes in temperature, and thus results in a temperature sensor with a higher sensing resolution. For our temperature sensor, we will use <code>R = 1kOhm</code> at room temperature since that gives us a pretty high sensitivity, but you could also go higher. <span style="color:red">Could we say something here about what ohm differences are realistic to measure? what does 'pretty high sensitvity' mean? 10 values? 100 values? 0.1C or 0.01C measurements?</span><br><br>

    <span style="color:red">perhaps we can add a small todo for students here? i.e. you want to measure XX temperature resolution, what overall resistance should you use?</span><br><br>

    <h3 id="XX">(3) Choose Wire Thickness (A)</h3>

    Now that we know that our desired overall resistance R is 1kOhm, what values should we use for wire length (l) and the wire thickness (A). As you can see in the formula, the longer the wire (l) and the thinner (A) the wire, the higher the resistance will be. Since longer wires take up more space on our prototype, which we don't want, we should first try to minimize the thickness to increase the resistance.<br><br>

    <b>Thickness of the Wire (A):</b> We ran a few experiments and found that the thinnest trace we can print is <span style="color:red">0.3mm wide</span>. Any thinner than this and the silver does not connect reliably anymore to form a trace. Thus, we will use <code>A = 0.3mm</code> for our temperature sensor.<br><br> 

    <h3 id="XX">(4) Determine Thermal Resistivity (p)</h3>

    Next, we need to determine the thermal resistivity (p). Since we want to solve the formula for <code>R = 1kOhm</code> at room temperature, we will determine p at <span style="color:red">23&#8451; (what temperature did you use?).</span>. <span style="color:red">why is it enough to only do this for one p? we will never determine the other p right? they will be implicitly measured in the overall resistance R?</span><br><br> 

    <b>Experimentally Determining Thermal Resistivity (p):</b> To determine (p), we printed a wire of thickness <code>A = 0.3mm</code> and wire length <code>l = 1cm</code>. We measured the overall resistance <code>R</code> at room temperature <span style="color:red">23&#8451;</span> using a multimeter and found the overall resistance <code>R = 7.5 Ohm/cm</code>. <span style="color:red">So how does this tell us the thermal resistivity (p)? Since the wire thickness (A) is constant, you can remove it from the formula. This leaves us with R = p * l.</span> Since we used l = 1cm, we can conclude that R = p. Thus, <code>p = 7.5 Ohm/cm</code> at room temperature <span style="color:red">23&#8451;</span>. <br><br> 

     Note that this can also vary depending on the substrate, the 2D printer, and the silver ink mixture, so if you change any of these you would have to remeasure the resistance.<br><br> 


    <h3 id="XX">(4) Determine Wire Length (l)</h3>

    Finally, we can determine the wire length (l) based on all the other values.<br><br>

    <b>Wire length (l) for 1kOhm:</b> Using the formula below, how long does your wire have to be to achieve a 1kOhm resistance? You will need to know your wire length when you design the inkjet printed wire in the next step.<br><br> 
    
    <pre>Overall Resistance (R) = wire length (l) * thermal resisvity (p(20C)) = l * 7.5 Ohm/cm</pre><br>



     <h3 id="XX">(1) Designing the inkjet printed temperature sensor</h3>


    



     <b>Shaping a long conductive wire into a compact form factor:</b><br>
    Now that we know how long the wire has to be, the next question that arises is how to best shape it to take up minimal space on our design? A classic method to create a long wire on a small area is to design it in a horse shoe pattern similar to this:<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab6/hsp.png" width="700px"><br><br>
       
    <b>Write Processing Script to generate line layout:</b><br>

    Since drawing this manually is quite the pain, we instead want to leverage our computational design capabilities in Processing. Write a Processing Script that generates a temperature sensor layout of variable length depending on a desired overall resistance. Reuse your code from pset1 to write this script. <br><br>

    The Processing script should have the following features:<br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>user input elements for line thickness (default: 0.3mm), overall resistance, and overall width of  temperature sensor (default: 7cm)</li>
        <li>generate a set of horizontal lines of the given thickness and connect them with vertical lines on alternating sides, the distance between each horizontal trace should be 0.5mm</li>
        <li>output a .pdf that contains the temperature sensor</li>
    </ol><br>
  
    Once you exported your pdf, you are ready to move onto the next step.<br><br>

    <h3 class="headline">(2) Extend Temperature Sensor Circuit with Wires<br> that Connect to EL display</h3>
    
    Now that we have our temperature sensor, it's time to plan how it will connect to the EL display so we can create the overall circuit layout that we want to attach to the mug. <br>
    Open your temperature sensor in Adobe Illustrator to extend it with the remaining circuit.<br><br>

    Below, you see an image of the mug for reference. <br><br>

    <img src="images/lab6/mug.png" width="300px"><br><br>

    And further below you see an image of the overall circuit layout that fits onto the mug and has all the elements you need for the circuit.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab6/mugCircuit.PNG" width="700px"><br><br>

    For your drawn circuit, aim for a total size aim of 17cm width and 7.5cm height so that the final design will fit nicely on the mug.<br>

    Your drawn circuit needs to include:<br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>the imported temperature sensor placed near the mug's handle</li>
        <li>your sprayed EL display on the opposite side of the handle <span style="color:red">(nothing you need to draw here, just make sure you plan for the space, i.e. there should be no overlap with the temperature sensor)</span></li>
        <li>4 connector pads to connect your microcontroller to the mug's circuit (each size: 3cmx1cm), i.e. two will be used to connect to the temperature sensor, the other two to the EL display </li>
        <li>2 printed wires that connect the connector pads to the temperature sensor (wire thickness: 1mm)</li>
        <li>2 printed wires that connect the connector pads to the EL display (wire thickness: 2mm, with a distance of a least 3cm between them at the location where they connect to the EL display to avoid short circuits). Note that the location of these wires depends on where you put the copper flap and copper strip onto your sprayed EL display. If they are not at the bottom of the display but instead at the top, you need to route one of the wires above the temperature sensors.
        </li>
    </ol><br>
    <h3 class="headline">(3) Fabrication and Assembly of Circuit, EL display, and Mug</h3><br>

    Now that you have the design ready, you can come in for fabrication and assembly.<br><br>

    <b>Inkjet print your circuit</b><br>
    Once you are done with your circuit design, please put it in your google drive, let us know on slack that you are ready for inkjet printing, and then book an OH slot.<br><br>

    <span style="color:red">Before you come to the office hour to print, please double check that:</span>

    <ol>
        <li>Thermal trace line width is 0.3mm</li>
<li>Spacing between thermal traces is 0.5mm</li>
<li>Total horizontal length of the thermal “block” is 7cm max</li>
<li>The spacing between your display-connected traces matches the distance between the two pieces of copper on YOUR display.</li>
<li>The total height of the system (e.g. the minimum bounding rectangle) is of maximum height 3in</li>
<li>The temperature sensor does not overlap with the display.</li>
<li>Please bring the EL display with you to the OH so we can double check everything there.</li>
</ol><br>
    
    Also when you come in, please don't forget to pick up:<br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>the mug</li>
        <li>a 1 kOhm resistor</li>
        <li>a roll of copper tape</li>
    </ol>

    <img src="images/lab7/copper-tape.png" width="300px"><br><br>

    <b>Test resistance of your temperature sensor</b><br>
    Once your print is done and before you continue with assembly, check if the temperature sensor has the correct resistance of 1kOhm.<br> 
    Use a multimeter and hold its two electrodes on the two corresponding connector pads (see image below).<br> 
    You should read a value close to 1 kOhm. If not, please let us know and we can help debug.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab7/testingTemperature2.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>
    
    <b>Attach your sprayed EL Display on the Circuit</b><br>
    Once you have printed your circuit and verified that the temperature sensor is having the right resistance, you are ready to attach your EL display to it.<br><br>

    First lay your circuit on a flat surface. Take a roll of copper tape and cut of two 6cm long pieces. Glue one half of each copper stripe on the two wires that lead to your display and bend the other half around such that the adhesive side faces upwards. <br>  
    Make sure that the two copper stripes don't connect to each other and have a save distance of at least 1cm. <br><br>

    <img src="images/lab7/copperOpen.png" width="350px">
    <img src="images/lab7/copperClosed.jpg" width="350px"><br><br>


    Next, stick your display onto the sticky area of the bend-over copper stripes.<br>
    Make sure that one copper strip connects only to the ITO and the other copper strip only connects to the sprayed copper layer.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab7/copperDisplay.png" width="350px">
    <img src="images/lab7/displayOnCopper.jpg" width="350px"><br><br> 

    <b>Test Display Connection</b><br>

    Now, it's time to test if the connection between the display and the printed traces is working.<br>
    Take your battery and inverter circuit and connect it to the two connector pads on the left hand side of the circuit. <br>
    You should see that the display lights up.<br> 
    We will have an inverter and power supply at the OH, so you don't have to bring your own.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab7/displayTesting.png" width="400px"><br><br> 

    Once, you verified that everything works, you can tape the display on its edges onto the circuit sheet.<br> 
    Take some scotch tape and apply a stripe on the left and the right edge of your display.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab7/scotchOnOneSide.png" width="350px">
    <img src="images/lab7/scotchOnBothSides.jpg" width="350px"><br><br>

    <b>Attaching the entire circuit to the mug</b><br>
    Now we are ready to attach the entire circuit to the mug.<br>
    For this, we will use double sided tape.<br>
    In the OH, cut off a tape strip the length of your circuit design, i.e. it should be 17cm and attach it across the surface of the mug.<br> 
    Next, also remove the protective foil from the tape such that it is also adhesive on the top side.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab7/attachingTape.png" width="240x">
    <img src="images/lab7/mugWithTape.jpg" width="280px"><br><br>

    Now take your printed circuit and glue it onto your mug.<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab7/circuitToMug.png" width="300x">
    <img src="images/lab7/circuitOnMug.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>
    
    <b>Attaching wires to the silver connector pads</b><br>
    
    Next, you'll need jumper wires that can connect the mug to a breadboard and your ESP32.<br>
    Since the silver connector pads are not suitable for soldering, we instead solder the jumper wires onto little piece of copper tape and then attach those to the silver connector pads.<br><br>

    To do this, first cut of a copper strip for each silver connector pad.<br>
    The copper stripes should be about 3cm long, which is the size of your printed silver pads.<br>
    Take a soldering iron and apply a drop of solder on them. <br>
    Next, take a short jumper wire, hold it over the solder drop and press it down with the solder iron until it is well connected.<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab7/copperDrop.jpg" width="250x">
    <img src="images/lab7/jumperOnCopper.jpg" width="250px"><br><br>
    
    Repeat this for all 4 jumper wires.<br><br>
    
    Now, carefully attach the copper stripes onto your mug's connector pads.<br><br>
    <img src="images/lab7/fourConnectors.jpg" width="250x">
    <img src="images/lab7/jumpersAttached.jpg" width="250px"><br><br>
    
    To extend the wires and make them longer, you can connect male-to-female jumper wires that you got in your grey boxes to the four dangling wires.<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab7/jumperTogether.jpg" width="300px"><br><br> 
    
    <b>Protecting the Circuit from Moisture and Touching</b><br>

    The last step you need to do is to protect it from moisture.<br>
    This is especially important since we want to fill hot and cold water into it and some water may spill over (try to avoid it).<br>
    Also, we want to protect the circuit from constant touching, which may happen with a mug.<br>
    To protect the circuit, we will use clear tape to cover all the electronics.<br><br>
    
    To do this, cut off a 19cm long stripe of our extra wide 3inch tape.<br> 
    Carefully apply the tape on the entire circuit.<br> 
    If you make a mistake here, you need to continue rolling the tape over the circuit. You cannot remove the tape anymore since you might rip off the silver traces.<br>
    Therefore, be extra careful.<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab7/tapeOnDisplay.jpg" width="400px"><br><br> 

    <h3 class="headline">(4) Connecting to the Microcontroller and Building the Circuit</h3><br>
    
    Controlling this mug interface requires 2 parts.<br>
    <ol>
        <li>a circuit to control the EL display. You have completed this circuit already in lab 3 and will will use it in this lab. </li>
        <li>a circuit to read the resistance of your printed temperature sensor. We will do this now. 
        </ol>
        <br>
    
    <b>Building the temperature sensor circuit</b><br>
    Remember that to measure the temperature of the liquid in the mug, we need to measure the changes in resistance of the silver trace that makes up our temperature sensor.<br>
    So how can we measure resistance on the ESP?<br>
    Unfortunately, we can't. The ESP can only measure voltage but not resistance.<br><br> 

    However, there is a way to use changes in voltage to determine resistance. A circuit that allows us to do this is called a <b>voltage divider</b>. A schematic of a voltage divider looks like this:<br><br>

     <img src="images/lab7/voltage_divider.png" width="200px"><br><br>
    
    It consists of one <b>known resistor (R1)</b> and one <b>unknown resistor (R2)</b> that we want to measure. In our case, the unknown resistor R2 is our temperature sensor. For the known resistor R1, we can simply pick one but it's a good idea to pick something that matches your other resistor R2, i.e. we will use 1kOhm.<br><br>

    <b>Vin</b> is the 3.3V supply voltage from the ESP32.<br> 
    <b>Vout</b> is a voltage than will change when the resistance of our temperature sensor (R2) changes.<br><br>

    We can compute VOut using the following formula:<br><br>
    
    <pre>Vout = (R2*Vin)/(R1+R2)</pre><br>
    
    If we use a 1kOhm resistor for R1 and we connect the temperature sensor as R2, then we can solve the equation for R2 to determine the change in resistance, which ultimately allows us to determine the current temperature of the mug.<br><br>

    To get started with this, build the voltage divider on a breadboard and connect your temperature sensor on the mug to this circuit.<br><br>
    
    <b>Building the EL display control circuit</b><br>
    If you finished all task from lab3, you already have this circuit.<br>
    All that's left to do is to connect your EL display control cicuit to the corresponding wires on the mug. <br><br>

    <h3 class="headline">(5) Code for Reading Mug's Current Temperature and Adjusting Display</h3><br>

    Now that everything is wired up, you are ready to write the code for determining the temperature and adjusting the display brightness accordingly.<br>
    The display should be turned off when the mug is cold. It should start blinking at temperatures above >70C to help users avoid getting burned.<br><br>
    
    <b>Code for Reading Voltage from Voltage Divider Circuit</b><br>
    Use analogRead() to read the incoming voltage value from your voltage divider and write it to the Serial monitor. analogRead() returns the voltage value between 0V and 3.3V and maps it to an output range of 0 - 4095. What this means is that if you read a value of 2047 (4095/2), your voltage is around 1.65V (3.3V/2). If you see the voltage readings in the Serial monitor, move to the next stpe. <br><br> 
    
    <img src="images/lab7/voltage-readings.png" width="700px"><br><br>

    <b>Converting Voltage To Resistance Values</b><br>
    
    Now, it's time to apply the voltage divider formula from above.<br> 
    Use it to compute the resistance of your temperature sensor R2 and plot the values.<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab7/resistance-readings.png" width="700px"><br><br>

    <b>Smoothing the Signal with a Box Filter</b><br>
    You'll notice that the resistance values are fluctuating a lot.<br> 
    This is due to the limited precision of the ESP32 and environmental electric noise that slightly changes the read in voltage values. <br><br>
    
    Recall from the lecture 'Sensing: Touch', that we introduced a filtering technique to smooth out such noise.<br> 
    It's called a box filter and it works by saving an array of sensor values (the box) of a specific width (e.g., 300 values) and computing the mean of this box.<br> 
    As new sensing values get read in through analogRead(), the box moves forward by one value, i.e. the oldest element in the array gets replaced by the new value and you need to recompute the mean.<br><br>
    
    Implement a box filter that smoothens out the values from analogRead().<br> 
    Use a box width of 300 values.<br> 
    Once you have completed the filter, your results should look like this:<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab7/filtered_large3.png" width="700px"><br><br>

    You see that the filter first collects 300 values and the mean is increasing with every new value. When the box is full, we can have a stable resistance value. Below we see a zoomed in graph of the filtered values. The fluctuation is reduced to just 20Ohm  (instead of 300Ohm without filtering, which is 15x more noisy!).<br><br>
    <img src="images/lab7/filtered_small2.png" width="700px"><br><br>

    <b>Measuring temperature with resistance increase</b><br>
    Now, it's time to conduct an experimen.<br>
    How much does the resistance changes as the temperature of a liquid inside the mug increases?<br><br>

    First, note down your current mean resistance at room temperature.<br> 
    Get some water to boil to 100C and pour it into the mug while you continue to plot the resistance values with the serial plotter.<br> 
    You should notice that the values start increasing while the mug is heating up. <br>
    Once you reached a stable value, note it down as well.<br> 
    The value increase should be around 4%.<br><br>
    
    <b>Connecting Temperature/Resistance Increase to Display Behavior</b><br>
    Next, use your temperature sensor values to set different states for your display. <br> 
    While the mug is at room temperature or below around 60C, it should be turned off.<br>
    The display should blink if the mug is really hot and ready to drink (i.e., the temperature when you poured in the boiling water, around 80C (the boiling water gets a bit colder than 100C when you pour it into a cold mug).<br><br> 
    
    Your final design should look like this:<br><br>

    At the end of Lab 4, upload to your student google drive:
    <ul>
        <li>the Processing code (.pde) to generate a temperature sensor</li>
        <li>the Arduino code (.ino) for controlling your display and reading the temperature</li>
        <li>2-3 photos (.jpg or .png) from different angles of your mug</li>
        <li>a short video (.mov or .mp4, max. 1 minute) showing how your display turned off at room temperature and starts blinking after pouring in boiling hot water in it.</li>
    </ul>

In this lab series, you will create an interactive mug. The mug consists of a sprayed electroluminescent display and an inkjet printed temperature sensor. When the user pours in tea or coffee, the mug can sense the temperature of the liquid and when its too hot, blink the display as a warning.<br><br>
