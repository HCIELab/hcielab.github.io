        <h2 class="headline">Lab 11: Interactive Fabric</h2>
      

In the last lab, you 3D printed the base of our interactive lamp. In this lab, you will add the interactive lamp shade by sewing touch sensors with conductive yarn into its fabric. In addition, you will mount LEDs into the base of the lamp that will light up in different colors depending on which touch sensor on the lamp shade it touched. Finally, you will build the control circuit and program the touch recognition and LED lighting.<br><br>

    <ol>
        <li>laser cut the fabric for the lamp shade</li>
        <li>sew the fabric lamp shade cover together</li>
        <li>embroider the touch button with conductive yarn</li>

 <h3 class="headline">Deliverables Lab 6 (due Wednesday, Oct. 28, 2020, 11.59pm)</h3>
    
    At the end of lab 6, upload to your student google drive:
    <ul>
        <li>the ESP32 code to sense touch and control the LEDs</li>
        <li>2-3 photos (.jpg or .png) of your 3D printed lamp that shows the circuit and the assembled lamp</li>
        <li>a video that shows how the lamp turns on/off when touching the "on/off" button and how the lamp changes its color when pressing the three color scheme buttons</li>
    </ul><br>

<h3 class="headline">Before Starting Lab 6</h3>

Make sure you have your 3D printed lamp base and lamp shade from lab 5 at hand.<br><br>

        
<h3 class="headline">(6) Building the Touch and LED Control Circuit</h3>
    
Now that the lamp shade is full assembled, you can move on to building the circuit for the touch buttons and for controlling the LEDs colors. <br><br>
    
Since the lamp base is too small for regular breadboards, we supply you with mini-breadboards (see below).<br>
Remove the backing from the mini-breadboard, which will expose a layer of double-sided tape.<br>
Next, place your ESP onto the layer of double sided tape, the pins of the ESP should be facing away from the double sided tape (don't worry, the ESP is easy to pull off later if you need to remove it to work on your pset).<br>
The mini-breadboard and ESP should now hold together.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab10/minib_1.png" width="380px">
    <img src="images/lab10/minib_2.png" width="330px"><br><br>
    

<b>Building the LED Control Circuit</b><br>

    Next, we connect the LEDs.<br> 
    You see on the LED strip that there are 3 pins labeled <b>GND, 5V, and DIN</b>. <br><br>
   
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>GND:</b> Connect it to the GND pin on the ESP32. Always connect the GND first to protect the LEDs from voltage spikes!
        </li> 
        <li><b>5V:</b> This is different from the 3.3V we have used so far in the other labs and psets. Luckily, the ESP32 also has a 5V pin at the VIN pin. Usually, this pin is used to connect to an external power supply. However, if you connect your ESP with a USB cable to your computer, the pin will use the 5V power supply from the USB cable.
        </li>
        <li><b>DIN (Data-In):</b> This channel is used to encode which LED should turn on with which color. Connect DIN to a GPIO pin of your ESP32.</li>
    </ul><br>

    Before we will implement the color control, let's finish the rest of the circuit.<br><br>

<b>Building the Touch Button Control Circuit</b><br>

Let's start by connecting the 4 touch buttons to the ESP32 as you have learned in lab 1+2.<br> 
You will again use a 100kOhm resistor between the sender pin and the 4 receiver pins (please reuse your resistors from lab1/2).<br> 
Your final circuit should look similar to this:<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab10/circuit_1.jpg" width="350px">
    <img src="images/lab10/circuit_2.jpg" width="350px"><br><br>

<b>Mounting the Circuit into the Lamp Base</b><br>
    
    Now place the circut inside your lamp base.<br> 
    First pull the USB cable through the hole that you 3D modeled into your lamp base in lab 5.<br>
    Next, connect the USB cable to your ESP32 and carefully place the ESP with the circuit inside the lamp base.<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab10/usb_1.png" width="350px">
    <img src="images/lab10/usb_2.png" width="350px"><br><br>
    
    Don't put the lamp shade on top of the base just yet.<br> 
    We will first write the code for reading the touch input and controlling the light of the LEDs before we put everything together.<br><br>
    
<h3 class="headline">(7) Program the Touch Sensing and LED Blinking</h3>

In this final step, we will write code that can sense touch on all four touch buttons, implement the on/off functionality for the on/off button, and implement the 3 light color programs that are triggered with the other 3 touch buttons.<br><br>
    
<b>Code for Touch Sensing</b><br>    
For touch sensing, you can reuse the code from lab 1+2.<br> 
Print your touch signals to the Serial Monitor/Plotter to see if it works.<br> 
Make sure that you get a clear signal from all 4 touch buttons.<br>
Select a suitable threshold for each touch button to detect touch.<br><br>
    
<b>Programming the LEDs</b><br>    

The LEDs on the strip are called NEOPIXELS (WS2812B).<br>
Each LED represents a 'pixel' that can be addressed individually and can thus change color and brightness independent of the other LEDs on the strip.<br> 
The DIN (Data-In) pin on the strip transmits a specific protocol to address each LED individually.<br>
This is why the LEDs do not turn on immediately when you connect them to the power supply.<br>
Instead we first have to provide data through the DIN pin.<br><br>
    
To control the LEDs, you can use a library that handles the signal encoding for you.<br> 
This library is called <b>FastLED</b>.<br> 
You can download it directly from the Arduino IDE by clicking on <b>Sketch->Inlcude Libraries->Manage Libraries.</b><br> 
Search for FastLED and install it.<br>
If you are interested to see what is available in the <a href="http://fastled.io/docs/3.1/annotated.html">FastLED library, you can look at the documentation here.</a> <br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab10/fastled.png" width="700px"><br><br>

You have to include the library to be able to use it in your script:<br><br>

    <pre><code>#include &lt;FastLED.h&gt;</code></pre>

To declare an LED, you can use the CRGB datatype.<br>

<pre>
<code>CRGB led1;
</code></pre>

However, rather than declaring 4 LED variables individually to address each LED, we will use an array, which is more convenient.<br>

<pre><code>#define NUM_LEDS 4
    
CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];
</code></pre>
    
The library also requires to add each LED to its internal data structures.<br> 
You can do this in the setup() function with the following line:<br>

<pre><code>FastLED.addLeds&lt;NEOPIXEL,LED_PIN&gt;(leds,NUM_LEDS)
</code></pre>

The function requires the following parameters:<br>
<b>NEOPIXEL:</b> The FastLED library is a generic library for all sorts of LED types. So we need to tell it which LED type we have so it knows which protocol to use to send the data to the LED. NEOPIXEL is a constant defined in the <a href="http://fastled.io/docs/3.1/annotated.html">documentation of the FastLED library</a> and we can simply use it as an argument here. <br>
<b>LED_PIN:</b> this is the GPIO pin to the DIN pin. This variable has to be a constant so you should declare it with #define.<br>
<b>leds + NUM_LEDS:</b> We already declared these above so you just insert them here.<br><br>
    
You can assign a color to an LED by writing:<br><br>

<pre><code>leds[0] = CRGB::White;
</code></pre>
    
This color does not get sent to the LED immediately each time you assign a color to an LED.<br> 
Instead, you have to make the sending explicit by executing the command:<br><br>

<pre><code>FastLED.show();
</code></pre>
    
<b>Changing LED Color on Touch</b><br>    
Let's bring it all together.<br>
Implement the following end-to-end workflow:<br>

<ol>
    <li>When the on/off button is touched and the lamp is off, the lamp should turn on.</li>
<li>When the lamp turns on, all the LEDs should be set to white.</li>
<li>Touching one of the color-scheme buttons will set the lights to a color scheme of your choice (e.g. red, green, blue or whatever color scheme you like).</li>
<li>Finally, when the on/off button is touched and the lamp is on, the lamp should turn off.</li>
</ol><br>

Once everything works, put the lamp shade on the base.<br><br>
