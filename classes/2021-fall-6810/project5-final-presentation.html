 <h3 id="PRESENTATION">(1) Presentation</h3>

<b>Presentation Time:</b> Each team will have <code>5 minutes to present</code>. There will be no questions this time, we will ask our questions during the live demo session. Since we have 8 teams, we will be done with this part after ca. 40 minutes. The second part of class will then be your <code>live demos</code> (more on this below).<br><br>

<b>Splitting the Talk among Presenters:</b> Every student on the team needs to present a part of the slides. We recommend that each student presents the part they worked on but if that leads to too much switching back and forth you can also pick a different split. We know from the milestone spreadsheets who did what.<br><br>

<b>Template File in your Google Drive:</b> There is a template file in your google drive called <code>9-final-presentation.gslides</code>. Feel free to change the slide layout etc., this is just an example from last year to get you started.<br><br>

<b>Presentation Content:</b>

Your presentation should cover the following points:<br><br>

<ol>
	<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
	<li>What is the solution? (use your rotoscope, see below)</li>
	<li>What are technical challenges?</li>
	<li>How did you address them with what you build?</li>
	<li>What you have done so far (use milestone videos)</li>
	<li>What you plan to do next?</li>
</ol><br>

Spend the majority of your time on <code>what you build</code>, the <code>technical challenges</code> you encountered, and what <code>technical solutions</code> you found to address them. This does not mean whining about how many sleepless nights you had, but providing a clear overview of what worked/what didn't work, and how fixed it.<br><br>

<b>Add Presentation Link to Spreadsheet":</b> Once you are done with your slides, add the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tojauHWUN7r9yaKPJiGkxUVh82GuvNOrSA-cQjZGZUI/edit?usp=sharing">link to the slides here</a>.<br><br>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tojauHWUN7r9yaKPJiGkxUVh82GuvNOrSA-cQjZGZUI/edit?usp=sharing"> <img src="images/project4-midterm/googledocs.png" width="670px"></a><br><br>


 <h3 id="ROTOSCOPE">(2) Live Demo</h3>

After everyone finished their presentation, we will have a <code>live demo session</code>. <br>
<code>4 Teams will demo first (30 min)</code>, and then we will switch and have the other 4 teams demo (30 min).<br>
We will go in the order of presentation (whoever presented among the first 4 teams will also demo first).<br><br>

<b>Types of Live Demos:</b> There are <code>different levels of live demo</code>. 
<ol>
	<li>No functional device: Your device is just laying on the table, we can look at the hardware but it is not functional. You have at least a video running on a laptop that shows that it worked at some point.</li>
	<li>Device can be used by somebody from your team: Your device is functional and can be live demo-ed by somebody from your own project team.</li>
	<li>Device can be used by somebody from the teaching team: Your device is so robust that it works even when used by a member of the teaching team and not just by yourself</li>
</ol>

Our expectation is that your device can be used by somebody from the teaching team. However, if your device requires a lot of calibration, demo-ing on somebody from your own team is also sufficient. A non-functional demo is not sufficient and will lead to points lost.<br><br>

 <h3 id="ROTOSCOPE">(3) Upload Photos and Video of your Project</h3>

You already prepared a <code>rotoscope</code> for your project for the midterm presentation. For the final presentation, you now also need to take <code>photos, e.g. of your hardware or the device in use on a user's body</code> and make a <code>video for your project</code>.<br><br>

<b>Adding Photos and Video to Final Presentation:</b> We recommend you use the photos in your final presentation and also add the video. If your video is longer than 1-2 minutes, consider showing only a portion of the video in the final presentation, so you also have some time to talk.<br><br>

<b>Adding Rotoscope, Photo, Video to Google Drive:</b> Please <code>upload your rotoscope, photos, and video</code> to your team's google drive in the folder <code>'10-rotoscope-photos-video'</code>.<br><br>

 <h3 id="ROTOSCOPE">(4) Upload Code and Hardware Design Files</h3>

Finally, please upload all your code and hardware design files. <br><br>

<b>Code:</b> For code, please upload either the code directly or provide a github repository link with all the code file. Please make sure your code contains a <code>readme file</code> with instructions for how to run the code. Your code should also be properly <code>documented</code>.<br><br>

<b>3D Model / Laser Cut / Inkjet Print Files:</b> Please include any 3D model's you made for your project, both the source files (e.g. Blender or Solidworks files) and the 3D printable files (.stl). We also need files if you laser cut parts or inkjet printed circuits. Please clearly name the files so we know which file has which part.<br><br>

<b>PCB Files:</b> If you made a PCB board with Eagle or another software, please include the electronic design files as well.<br><br>

<b>Other files:</b> If we forgot to list something here, please still include it. There is a high chance that we will continue to work on the project with some of you, e.g. through a UROP and bring the project to publication, so we want to make sure that all the files are in the folder. In case the project will be published, we will make sure everyone receives credit who worked on the project, i.e. all our undergraduate researchers co-author the paper.<br><br>

For the group project, you will first choose a project idea, then write a technical proposal to describe how you will implement your idea. After this, you will meet with the teaching team for weekly milestone discussions. Once the prototype works, you will create presentation materials in the form of a rotoscope, photos, a video, and final presentation slides and also give a live demo on the last day of classes.<br><br>
