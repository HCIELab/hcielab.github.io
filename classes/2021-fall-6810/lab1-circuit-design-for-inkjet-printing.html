</div>

<h3 id="INSTALL">(1) Install Drawing Program and Download Visual Design File</h3>

<b>Download and Install Drawing Program:</b> We recommend to use <a href="https://ist.mit.edu/adobe/cc">Adobe Illustrator. All MIT students have access to free Adobe Creative Cloud licenses here</a>. All our instructions will be based on Adobe Illustrator. If you use a different drawing program that's fine but we may be less knowledgable on how to use it and may not be able to help you as much.<br><br>

<b>Download and Open Visual Design File:</b> To get started, <a href="images/lab1/lab1-music-card-final-size.pdf">download the visual design file for our music card here and open it in your drawing program.</a> Alternatively, you can also make your own design. Please see the left side bar to decide if you want to go down that route.<br><br>

<b>Adjust the Document Settings to mm:</b> Once you opened the design file, adjust the document settings by clicking on <code>Edit->Preferences->Units</code> and set all units from 'pts' to <code>mm</code>.</br><br>

<h3 id="BUTTON">(2) Add Touch Buttons</h3>

For our interactive card, we want to add three touch buttons, one on each note (we will later use them to go to the next and previous song and pause/play the song). Touch buttons consist of one shape + one wire + one connector pad. One end of the wire connects to the touch button shape and the other end connects to the connector pad which will in turn connect to the microcontroller.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/lab1-design-planning_new.png" width="350px" />
<img src="images/lab1/lab1-single-touch-button_new.png" width="350px"><br><br>
    
<b>Video Tutorial:</b> Below, you'll find a video tutorial that shows you all steps to add one touch button. Your task will be to add all three touch buttons on top if the notes.<br><br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMkACDna3CA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>

<b>Create a New Layer:</b> Start by creating a new layer in your design file. You need to create the circuit design on a separate layer than the visual design because later you need to export two files separately, the visual design in one .pdf and the circuit design in a separate .pdf. Using a separate layer for each allows you to turn each part of the design on/off quickly for export.<br><br>

<b>Draw the Touch Button Shape:</b> Once you created your circuit design layer, draw the first touch button on it. A touch button should be large enough for a user's finger. The size of a finger tip is roughly an area of 2cm x 2cm. In the design we gave you, the size of each note body is roughly the size of a finger pad, so as long as you make a shape the size of the note it should be fine.<br><br>

<b>Draw the Connector Pad:</b> In order to connect the touch sensor to your ESP32 microcontroller later, we have to add connector pads at the edge of the music card. We recommend to place all the connector pads for the touch buttons on one side of the card (we will later draw more connector pads for the slider, so leaving another side free will ensure we will have enough space later). The connector pad for the microcontroller needs to be large enough to connect to a crocodile clamp. Therefore, the connector pad should be 10mm x 10mm. Make sure your connector pads are close enough to the border of the card so that a crocodile clamp can reach it (we recommend to place them less than 5mm away from the card border). Make sure to not exceed the boundaries of the music card since we will later cut it out.<br><br>
    
<b>Draw the Wire:</b> Next, draw a wire from the touch button to the connector pad. Your wire should be 1mm thick. The thickness of the wire determines its conductivity (larger cross-section == higher conductivity). With 1mm we are on the safe side given the conductive ink we use and its resistance. Make sure that all wires are located inside the boundaries of your card since we will later cut out the card.<br><br>

Repeat all steps for the other two touch buttons.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/lab1-crocodiles.png" width="700px"><br><br>

<h3 id="SLIDER">(3) Add Touch Slider</h3>

In addition, the piano area should serve as a volume slider, i.e. if we drag our finger from left to right, the volume of the music that is playing will increase.<br><br>

<b>Discrete vs. Continous Sliders:</b>  Touch-sliders consist of multiple touch buttons linearly arranged, i.e. several segments and each segment has its own wire and connector pad that connect to the microcontroller. In the discrete slider design, the finger is only over one of the slider segments. In the continous design, the finger touches two adjacent slider segments. By knowing how much the finger touches each slider segment, we can extrapolate continuous transitions between the segments. We will create a continuous slider, i.e. the segments overlap.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/slider-designs1.png" width="300px"><br><br>

<b>Slider Resolution:</b> The slider resolution depends on the number of slider segments. More slider segments allow for higher resolution but since each slider segment needs its own wire, connector pad, and pin on the microcontroller it can quickly add up. For our purposes, we will create <code>5 slider segments.</code><br><br>

<b>Draw the Slider Segments:</b> Let's draw the slider segments, as well as their wires and connector pads. Below you see an image that already has two slider segments marked up, you need to divide the remaining 'piano' area to form another three slider segments and connect them via wires to additional connector pads. When you draw your slider segments, pay close attention that each slider segment overlaps with each other, i.e. you can see in the image below how the front of the first segment reaches deep into the second segment to maximize overlap. For the wires and connector pads for each slider segment, follow the same specification as before, i.e. use 1mm for wire thickness and 10mm x 10mm for connector pad size. For the spacing between slider segments use 2mm, this brings the slider segments as close as possible together without risking that they intersect.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/lab1-slider-segments_new.png" width="350px">
<img src="images/lab1/lab1-slider-overlap-labeled.png" width="360px"><br><br>
    
<b>Video Tutorial:</b> In this video tutorial, you will see how to create a slider segment and how to ensure a certain distance between them.<br><br>

<br><br>

<h3 id="VERIFY">(4) Verify your Design</h3>

Before printing out your design, let's double check that everything is correct. Below are some of the most common issues we have seen last year:<br><br>

<b>Drawing in pt instead of mm:</b> Make sure your drawing is in 'mm' not 'pt'. You can check this if you go to <code>Edit->Preferences->Units</code>.<br><br>

<b>Visual Design & Circuit Design Not Centered on Page:</b> Make sure your circuit drawing is centered on the page. If it is not centered and you print it out, your visual design and your circuit design will not overlap, i.e. your touch button will not be underneath the note. To check if your circuit drawing is centered, select your entire design and check if its x-coordinate is '107.95mm' or 4.25".<br><br>

<b>Gaps along wires:</b> Zoom into your drawing and make sure all your wires are connected, sometimes there are tiny gaps that you don't see in zoomed out mode. If you have a gap, your wire will not work. Check: (1) Is each wire connected to its corresponding touch buttons/slider segments? (2) Is each wire connected to its connector pad? (3) If your wire consists of multiple individual drawn rectangles, are they all connected to each other?<br><br>

<b>Wires routed too close to Touch buttons/Slider Segments:</b> Make sure you leave sufficient space between the wires and the touch buttons and slider segments. If they are too close to each other there can be cross talk, i.e. touching one button can create a signal on a close-by wire of another button, which then also detects that it was touched.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/common-design-issues-gaps2.jpg" width="650px"><br><br>

<b>Slider Segments not overlapping enough:</b> Finally, your slider segments should be close together. If they don't overlap enough, your finger will only touch one of them, which will not result in a continous slider signal. Aim for a distance of 2mm between slider segments.<br><br>

<b>Slider Segments too close to each other:</b> Make sure there is sufficient space between each slider segment. If they are too close, you will also have problems with cross talk, i.e. touching one slider segment will automatically activate the other as well. Aim for a distance of 2mm between the segments.<br><br>

<b>Check your design for no overlapping wires and connector pads:</b> After printing the card, you will cut it out. Check that all your silver traces are within the boundaries of the card design otherwise you will cut them off.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/common-design-issues-slider.jpg" width="650px"><br><br>


<h3 id="EXPORT">(5) Export your Design</h3>

Now that you have verified your design, you are ready to export and print it. Since for capacitive touch sensing, the user should never touch the silver directly, we will print the circuit design on one side of a piece of paper and the visual design on the other side.<br><br>

<b>Mirror the Circuit Layer:</b> In order to accommodate the double-side printing, we will need to mirror the circuit design, otherwise if we flip the sheet for printing the touch buttons and the notes will not align. We don't want to mirror the visual design since it would look very odd to the user if the notes where flipped. To instead flip the circuit design in Adobe Illustrator, first select all objects in the circuit design layer, then go to <code> Object --> Transform --> Reflect</code>, and select <code>Vertical</code>.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/lab1-mirror-circuit-design2.png" width="720px" /><br><br>
<img src="images/lab1/lab1-before-after-mirror-ing2.png" width="720px" /><br><br>

<b>Export .pdf files:</b> Save your design as two separate .pdf files, one for the visual design and one for the circuit design. To export the visual design, turn the circuit layer off by going to the layer tap and clicking on the <code>eye icon</code> in front of the layer's name. Save the document as a .pdf by clicking on <code>File -> Save as</code> and select as file type <code>pdf</code>. Repeat the process for exporting the circuit design layer. Finally, also save the combined design as a third pdf for the teaching team to help you with debugging if needed.<br><br>

<b>Upload .pdf's to Google Drive:</b> Once you have your three .pdfs, add them to your student google drive folder. Please name them: <code>combined-visual-circuit.pdf</code> with both layers, <code>visual-design.pdf</code> with only the visual design, and <code>circuit-design.pdf</code> with only the circuit design. Let us know on slack that you are ready to have your design checked by us.<br><br>

<h3 id="CIRCUIT">(6) Print the Circuit</h3>

 <div style="color:red; border: red 1px solid; padding: 20px;margin-bottom:20px;">
If there is a line at the printers, we recommend you either <a href="laser-cut-business-card.html" style="color:red">(1) start with your laser cut business card homework</a>, or  <a href="lab2-sensing-touch-button.html" style="color:red">(2) go to Lab 2 and start installing Arduino, the ESP core etc. and pick up your hardware bag from the teaching team.</a> Please only pick up your hardware bag today if you are sure you will stay in this class.</div>

For printing our circuit, we use silver ink from <a href="http://www.mitsubishiimaging.com/digital-imaging-diamond-jet-NANOINK.html">Mitsubishi</a> and a special paper. While in the printer, the silver ink is not yet conductive since it is not yet sintered. The special paper on which we print the silver ink has a coating that chemically sinters the silver ink once it adheres to the sheet. For today, we are using the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kodak-8209017-KOD8209017-Photo-Paper/dp/B000EZ0CTU"> Kodak glossy photo paper</a> (white), which has this special coating.<br><br>

<b>Open Circuit Design File:</b> Let's start with printing the circuit design. Go to one of the Epson printers and open your <code>circuit-design.pdf</code> from your student google drive folder.<br><br>

<b>Insert Paper:</b> Next, insert the paper. The paper has two sides, a glossy (shining) side and a non-glossy (matte) side. The glossy side should be facing up.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/silver_printer1.JPG" width="337px" />
<img src="images/lab1/silver_printer2.JPG" width="337px" /><br><br>

<b>Set Printer Settings:</b> Go to print, and from the 'Printer' dropdown select the <code>Epson ET-2760</code>. Next, click <code>Setup</code> (bottom left corner), then <code>continue</code>. Go to <code>Quality and Media</code> in the dropdown, then select <code>Media Type</code> and <code>Photo Glossy Paper</code>. Then go to <code>Print Quality</code> and drag the quality to the right most <code>Best</code> setting. Now you are ready to hit the print button.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/printer_dialog1.png" width="700px" /><br>
<img src="images/lab1/printer_dialog2.png" width="700px" /><br><br>

<b>Use Gloves to Handle Printed Circuit:</b> Right after printing, the silver ink has not yet been fully cured, this takes a few hours. Therefore, you need to handle the printed circuit carefully as you could accidentially scrape off some silver with your fingers, especially if you have sweaty hands. Therefore, we ask you to handle the newly printed silver circuits with gloves on. <br><br>

<b>Check if your Print is Conductive:</b> Before you print the color layer, let's first check if the silver layer is conductive or if anything went wrong during the print. Sometimes print nozzles clog and then some silver particles cannot exit through the nozzle, which leaves small gaps in your printed area, which reduces conductivity. The print is successful, i.e. highly conductive as indicated by a low resistance, if silver was deposited over the entire area. The print was unsuccessful if there are many tiny gaps, i.e. conductivity is low as indicated by a high resistance. To check the resistance, we can use a Digital multimeter (DMM).<br><br>

<b>Using a Digital Multi-Meter to Check Resistance:</b> Set the multimeter to <code>Continuity</code> mode. It may vary among DMMs, but look for a diode symbol with propagation waves around it (like sound coming from a speaker). Let's first check if the multimeter works at all. For this, touch the two probes together. The multimeter should emit a tone. This shows that a very small amount of current is flowing without resistance (or at least a very very small resistance) between probes, which is what we want. Next, hold the two measurement points at the beginning and end of a wire on your card to measure the resistance along the trace. Be careful with the probes since they are pointy and they may scratch off some silver. You should have a resistance of <code>less than 300 ohms</code> for your print. If you see a <code>OL</code> message in the display, your trace is broken and the resistance was so high it couldn't be displayed because it was out of range. If that happens to you, let us know and we will print your design again.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/lab1-multimeter1_new.jpg" width="350px"> <img src="images/lab1/lab1-multimeter3_new.jpg" width="350px"><br><br>  

<b>Installing the Silver Inkjet Printer Driver:</b> For lab, we had you print from our shared computers since it is faster. If you want to print from your own computer in OH or during the group project, you can install the <a href="https://epson.com/Support/Printers/All-In-Ones/ET-Series/Epson-ET-2760/s/SPT_C11CG22203"printer driver for the >Epson EcoTank ET-2760 Printer Driver from here.</a><br><br>

<!-- Here we have a fantastically low resistance of 13ohm with a beep sound. <br> -->

<h3 id="VD">(7) Print the Visual Design</h3>

Let's print the visual design on the other side of the paper.<br><br>

<b>Open Visual Design File:</b> Go to one of the Canon printers and open your <code>visual-design.pdf</code> from your student google drive folder.<br><br>

<b>Flip Paper and Insert into Color Printer:</b> We will print the music card design on the back side of the printed silver circuit. Make sure that you <code>flip the photo paper with correct rotation</code> so that the music card visual design and the circuit design matches up (see photos below). 

To set the print settings, repeat the steps from the circuit print above. <br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/silver_in_colorprinter.JPG" width="437px" />
<!-- <img src="images/lab1/silver_in_colorprinter2.JPG" width="357px" /><br><br> -->
<img src="images/lab1/silver_in_colorprinter3.JPG" width="272px" /><br><br>
<!--  (i.e choose <span style="color:red">glossy paper</span>, high quality print .etc) but do <b style="color:red">not</b> hit the 'grayscale' checkbox since we want to print in color for higher visual quality. <br><br>
 -->
Once you have the visual design printed on the back side it should look like this. <br><br>

<b>Installing the Color Inkjet Printed Driver:</b> If you want to print from your own computer in OH or during the group project, you can install the <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/printers/mobile-compact-printer/pixma-tr150">Canon PIXMA TR150 Printer Driver from here</a>.<br><br>

<h3 id="LAMINATION">(8) Laminate your Circuit Design</h3>
The last step for lab 1 is cutting the music card from the excess paper around it and finally laminating your card, so it is protected from any damage before you use it for the next labs.<br><br>
    
<b>Cut the music card:</b> Before you can start laminating the card, you have to cut it out. Use a scissor or rotary trimmer to do it.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab1/cutting_card.jpg" width="357px"><br><br>  

<b>Cut the lamination sheet to be the size of the card:</b>  Before you can start laminating, you have to cut the lamination sheet to have the size of the music card. Lamination works by sandwiching the card design between two lamination sheets that are then fused together. Pick up a pair of lamination sheets (two transparent sheets that are glued together on one end) and put you music card between the two sheets. Push the card up to the side with the glued together edges. Next, with the card inside the lamination sheets, cut the lamination sheet along the edges of the music card while leaving <code>1-2cm space around the card</code>. This frame will later glue together and hold the music card in place.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab1/placing_card_in_sheets.jpg" width="357px">
    <img src="images/lab1/cut_lamisheet.JPG" width="345px"><br><br>   
    

<b>Cut out the holes for the connector pads:</b> If you laminated the card as is, we would not be able to access the conductive silver of the connector pads anymore. Thus, you have to cut out a hole in the top lamination sheet for each connector pad. To do that, turn around the music card such that you can see the silver traces. Take a scissor and cut out a rectangle on the top lamination sheet where the connector pad is.<br><br>
    
<img src="images/lab1/card_in_sheets_labels.jpg" width="450px"><br><br>
    
<b>Laminate your card:</b> Make sure that the laminator is turned on and set to <code>hot lamination</code>. If it is not warm, ask a TA for help.<br>
Slide your music card into the front of the laminator. At some point you should feel that the machine starts to pull the card in. Now, you only have to wait for a few seconds. When the lamination is done, you can pull out you card from the back of the laminator.<br><br>
    
<img src="images/lab1/lamination1.JPG" width="307px">
<img src="images/lab1/lamination2.JPG" width="425px"><br><br>
    
Your end result should look like this:<br><br>

In this lab series, you will create an interactive music card. Underneath the visual design, the music card has an inkjet printed circuit with touch buttons and a slider that allow the user to play songs and control the volume. The card is connected to a microcontroller for analyzing user input and then sends the signals to a program called Processing for visualizing user input on screen.<br><br>


<h4 class="medium.headline" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Use our design or make your own</h4><br>

You have the choice to either use our template design files or to make your own design. That means either using our card design (three notes + piano keyboard) or to make your own card design. If you are a beginner in electronics and fabrication, we recommend you go with the default design since it is the safest path to success. However, if you are a designer at heart and you have some prior knowledge in electronics and making, it may be more interesting for you to make your own. If you decide to make your own, please make sure you read ahead what's coming in lab 2/3/4. There is also the risk that your own design will have its own bugs that we are less knowledgable about. Below you see a custom design from 6.810 student Diego Pinochet from last year that  features a circular slider rather than a straight one and additinal input buttons for extra functionality.<br><br>
