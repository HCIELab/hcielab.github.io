<h3>Make sure everything from last lab is still working</h3>

Before getting started with the new content, let's first make sure everything from last lab is still working. Connect your printed music card to the ESP32 and the ESP to your computer via USB. Upload the Arduino program that you wrote in the last lab. Double check that when touching one of the touch buttons you see the touch signals printed on the Arduino Serial monitor. If you see this, you are ready to start today's lab.<br><br>

<hr>

<h3 id="INSTALLPROCESSING">(1) Install Processing</h3>

Since Arduino has no libraries for graphical user interfaces, we will send our touch input to a program called Processing that can render our music card and the touch buttons on the screen. <a href="https://processing.org" target="_blank">Processing</a> is a user interface protoyping platform that is based on Java. It was created by MIT students (and others) in their spare time in 2001 and is nowadays used by thousands of makers and UI designers.<br><br>

<b>Install Processing:</b> You can <a href="https://processing.org/download/">download and install Processing using this link here</a>.<br><br>

<b>Getting Started Tutorials:</b> Processing has a <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/" target="_blank">lot of useful minitutorials with code snippets that you can find here</a>.<br><br>

<b>Processing API:</b> You can find all <a href="https://processing.org/reference/" target="_blank">available classes and functions here in the Processing API.</a><br><br>

<h3 id="NEWPROCESSINGPROGRAM">(2) Create New Processing Program</h3>

<b>Create New Processing Program:</b> Open Processing and create a new program.<br><br>

<b>setup() and draw() functions:</b> Similar to Arduino, every Processing program has two functions: one that is run only once (setup()) and one that is looping forever (draw()). Create both functions in your empty Processing file.<br><br>

<pre>
void setup() { // runs only once
  
}
</pre><br>

<pre>
void draw() { //runs infinitely
  
}
</pre><br>

<h3 id="OPENSERIAL">(3) Open Serial Connection in Processing</h3>

In the last lab, we wrote a program that sends our touch signals from the ESP microcontroller through the Serial port (USB cable) to our computer. We had then used the Serial Monitor in the Arduino Programming environment to look at the touch signals coming through the Serial port. However, since any program can read from the Serial port, we are not dependent on Arduino, and can also use Processing to read the data and do something interesting with it.<br><br>


<b>Import Serial Library:</b> Import the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/libraries/serial/index.html">Serial library</a>.<br>
<pre>import processing.serial.*;</pre><br>

<b>Open Serial Connection:</b> Next, let's define the serial connection in the setup() function we just created. To open the serial connection, you need to create a new port that can be used for communication by creating an object from this class: <br>
<pre>Serial myPort;</pre><br>

To create the port, you need to define three things: 
<ol>
<li>which application will listen to the port (i.e. 'this' one)</li> 
<li>which portname to use (same as you used in Arduino)</li>
<li>which baudrate is expected to be able to decode the messages (same as you used in Arduino)</li>
</ol> 

<pre>myPort = new Serial(this, <span style="color:red">int</span> portName, <span style="color:red">int</span> baudrate);</pre><br>

<i>portName:</i> For the <code>portName,</code> you can get a list of all available ports from the Serial library. By accessing different buckets of the list, you can get access to the name of each port. The correct port is the one you also used in your Arduino program, i.e. this is where the microcontroller is connected to your laptop. Check if the correct portname is in bucket 0, 1, or 2 by printing it and then use the bucket as the parameter in the Serial constructor.<br>

<pre>// check which port you use: 0, 1, 2?
String portName = Serial.list()[2];
print(portName);</pre><br>

<i>baudrate:</i> For the <code>baudrate</code>, you already know this from your Arduino program that you uploaded to the microcontroller. Check in your Arduino program with which baudrate you initialized the Serial communication and then use it as the parameter in the Serial constructor. If you use a different baudrate than you wrote into the Arduino program, you will only get a lot of random stuff back since your Processing application will not know how to 'translate' the messages that are coming from the microcontroller since it would 'speak' at a different frequency than the Processing application would 'listen'.<br><br>

Now that the port is defined, your program can listen to it and check if data is available.<br><br>

<h3 id="SERIALREAD">(4) Serial Read Data into Processing</h3>

Now that we have the port defined, we can see if data is available and if the answer is yes, we can read the data from the port.<br><br>

<b>Reading Serial Data into a String:</b> Below, we provide some starter code for you to read the Serial data into a string. Add the lines to your draw() function so they are executed continuously:<br><br>

<pre>
// we are sending data in the format: <i>(sensor ID),(is_touched)(newline)</i> (4 characters)
// (sensor ID) is either 0, 1 or 2 and represents the ID of the observed touch sensor
// (is_touched) is either 0 or 1 (0 if the sensor is not touched, and 1 if it is touched)

// If there is a message with at least 4 characters 
if (myPort.available() >= 4) { 

    <span style="color:red">// read a String until the character ';' is found, which indicates the end of our message</span>
    String val = myPort.readStringUntil(';'); 
  }</pre><br>

<b>Reading Strings vs. other Datatypes:</b> Note that we use <code>myPort.readStringUntil()</code>, which we can do because we are sending a String on the serial port from our microcontroller. If we send other data-types, we would have to use a different function so Processing knows how to convert the un-typed data that is coming through the port at the specific baudrate.<br><br>

<b>Print Received Strings:</b> Next, print the received String values to the Processing command line using the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/print_.html">print() function</a>.<br><br>

<b>Testing if you Receive Data:</b> Before you run your Processing program, check one more time that the printed music card is connected to the ESP and the ESP is connected to your computer, and that the ESP is actually on and running its microcontroller program. Once you confirmed this, run your Processing program, and touch your touch sensor to see if the statements you printed to Serial port are getting printed on the Processing command line. If you are getting a ‘port busy’ error, make sure you close the Serial Monitor / Plotter on Arduino IDE since only one program can read from the Serial port at a time.<br><br>

<h3 id="EXTRACTTOUCHSTRING">(5) Extract Touch Sensor Information from the String</h3>

What we are currently printing to the command line are Strings in the format of "0,1;" (sensor_ID,is_touched;). However, to do something useful with this data in our code, we have to split it into individual values, i.e. the sensor_ID and and if the sensor is touched/not touched.<br><br>

<b>String split() function:</b> Use the String split() function to split your String into individual values. You can find information on <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html" target="_blank">split() and how to use it in the Java String reference</a>. Once you have both the <code>sensor_ID</code> and <code>is_touched</code> separated, we recommend you check that this is working by printing them to the command line before moving on.<br><br>

<h3 id="DRAWDIGITALBUTTON">(6) Draw a Digital Touch Button</h3>

In the next step, we want to create a bar that goes up if the touch sensor is touched and down if the touch sensor is not touched. Let's start with a single bar for touch sensor #1 and we can do the rest later.<br><br>

<b>Set Size of GUI window:</b> By default, Processing already gives us a GUI window of a default size. However, for our purposes we need a larger window. Set the size of the window to 500px x 500px. You can <a href="https://processing.org/reference/size_.html">find more about it here in the size() reference</a>.<br><br>

<b>Create a bar:</b> Create a bar (i.e. rectangle) with a fixed width of 100px and a fixed height of 300px. You can find useful information on how to do this here in the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/rect_.html">Rect reference</a> and the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/rectMode_.html">RectMode reference</a>.<br><br>

<b>Color the bar:</b> Color the bar in a color of your choice. You can find more information about this in the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/fill_.html">Fill reference</a>. If you also want to color the background you can find out about this in the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/background_.html">Background reference</a>.<br><br>

Once you are done it should look like this:<br><br>

<img src="images/lab3/lab2-bar-up.png" width="250px"><br>

<h3 id="TOUCHSIGNALTOBUTTON">(7) Connect Incoming Touch Signal to On-Screen Touch Button</h3>

Next, we will connect the height of the bar to the incoming touch signal.<br>
A high bar shows that the sensor is being touched.<br>
A low bar shows that the sensor is not being touched.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab3/lab2-touched-not-touched.png" width="550px"><br><br>

<b>Identifying if Incoming Touch Signal is for Touch Button 1:</b> If you use a String comparison to find which data belongs to touch button 1, remember you cannot use <code>stringVariable == "StringValue"</code>. Instead you need to use <code>equals()</code>. Check <a href="https://processing.org/reference/String_equals_.html">the reference here for equals()</a>. If you plan to use a boolean in Processing, the datatype is spelled out <code>boolean myVariable;</code> not <code>bool</code> like in Arduino.<br><br>

<b>Redrawing the Bar:</b> When you redraw the bar with its new height, remember to first clear the background at the beginning of the draw() function. Otherwise, you are just drawing each update on top of the previous update, so you may actually not see the bar changing since a shorter bar overlaid over a longer bar is not visible. Use <code>background(255,255,255);</code> or any other color you like.<br><br>

Once you are done, it should look like in the image above.<br><br>
 
<b>Extend Visualization to 3x Touch Buttons</b> Once you have the first touch bar done, extend the user interface to have a bar for all three touch sensors.<br>
It should look like the image below.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab3/lab2-three-bars-multiple-touched2.png" width="650px"><br><br>

Touching multiple touch sensors simultaenously also works. This should be a bit surprising to you, since we can only read one message at a time in the draw() function. The reason it still works is that we are reading messages at such a high speed that the processing gap is not visible to the human eye.<br><br>

<h3 id="PROCESSINGSOUND">(8) Install Processing Sound Library + Run Skeleton Code</h3>

Now that you have basic touch input working in Processing, you can connect it to our music player application.<br><br>

<b>Install Processing Sound Library:</b> Before you can use Processing to play music, you need to install the Processing Sound Library. In Processing, go to 'Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library'. Then in the 'Libraries' Tab, search for 'sound' and install the one that is officially from Processing (see image below).<br><br>

<img src="images/lab3/lab2-add-library.png" width="300px"><img src="images/lab3/lab2-add-library-sound.png" width="400px"><br><br>

<b>Run Skeleton Code:</b> Once you have the library installed, download our <a href="software/music_card_nosolution.zip">music card skeleton code from here</a>. Inside the folder, open and run the 'music_card_nosolution.pde', it will take a little while to load until you see the music card image in the view because we also load the mp3 audio files for the songs, which takes some time. You should see the music card being loaded into your application as shown below. If you don't see it, please let us know.<br><br>
    
<img src="images/lab3/lab2-loadedcard_new.png" width="400px"><br><br>


<h3 id="DIGITALCARD">(9) Implement Digital Music Card</h3>

Let's first implement the digital music card i.e. when we press the notes on the screen they should play/pause the music or go the next/previous song.<br><br>

<b>Music Card Functionality:</b> 
<ul>
  <li>left note: previous song</li>
  <li>middle note: play/pause</li>
  <li>right note: next song</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Convert On-Screen Notes into Buttons:</b> To convert the notes on screen into buttons, we already implemented a class 'Buttons' for you. You can make a new button with:<br>

<pre><span style="red">myButtons.add(new Button(x_top_left, y_top_left, x_bottom_right, y_bottom_right, drawing-mode));</span></pre>

Please add your buttons to line 49 onwards. One of the buttons is already defined there:<br>
<pre>myButtons.add(new Button(360, 180, 440, 260, "Ellipse")); //line 49</pre><br>
    
Your final result should look like this:<br>
    
<img src="images/lab3/card_buttons_new.png" width="350px"><br clear=all><br>


<b>Create Button Press Events:</b> To create events on mouse click, we need to implement several mousePressed() events. We already did this for you in the code further down in the class.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab3/lab2-button-presses.png" width="600px"><br clear=all><br>

We first iterate over all the buttons you created and then depending on the button ID, we execute a music function. We created a music class that loads several example songs in your project folder and has the functions:<br><br>
<pre>music.play();
music.pause();
music.back();
music.forward();
</pre><br>

You can see in the switch/case code that we already assigned the middle button to play and pause music. Extend the code to also go to the next and previous songs. To test your code, click onto each note and see if the expected music playing functionality is executed.<br><br>

<b>Hide the Touch Buttons:</b> While we want to have a touch button on each note, we don't want to see the white ellipses since they make the card look less good. We already prepared a piece of code for this for you: Press the 'h' key on your keyboard while your program runs.
It will hide the buttons but you can still click on them. If you want to see them again, press 's' (for show). Study the code to see where this was implemented and how we did it.<br><br>

<h3 id="INTEGRATEDTOUCHSENSING">(10) Integrate Touch Sensing with Music Application</h3>

Now that we have the user interface that we can control digitally and we tested that everything works by clicking onto each note to play/pause and go to previous/next song, we also want to play some music from the physical card.<br><br>

<b>Add Previous Touch Bar Code to Music Application:</b> You already implemented the Serial communication and the message decoding in the previous exercise, i.e. the Processing application you wrote for displaying the touch bars that go up and down. Add this code to the music card program and instead of increasing the height of your bar you are now calling the music functions.<br><br>

<b>Test Physical Card:</b> Once you have finished the code, try if it works by touching the notes of your printed music card to play/pause the song and go to the next/previous song. Remember to not interact on the silver side but to touch on the side of the visual design.<br><br>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

At the end of the lab, upload to your student google drive:
<ol>
  <li>the Processing code (.pde) you wrote for Serial communication that displays the three touch bars and the slider bar</li>
  <li>the Processing code (.pde) of the completed music card application</li>

In this lab series, you will create an interactive music card. Underneath the visual design, the music card has an inkjet printed circuit with touch buttons and a slider that allow the user to play songs and control the volume. The card is connected to a microcontroller for analyzing user input and then sends the signals to a program called Processing for visualizing user input on screen.<br><br>
