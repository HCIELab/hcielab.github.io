<h3 id="1">(1) Build Slider Circuit</h3>

The first step is to build the circuit for the slider. Remember that the slider is just a bunch of touch buttons placed right next to each other. Thus, the circuit for each slider segment is the same as for a touch button.<br><br>
    
<b>One Sender Pin, Different Receiver Pins:</b> When you wire up your slider segments, remember they can all use the <code>same sender pin</code> but need a <code>different receiver pin</code>. Refer to <a href="lab2-sensing-touch-button.html" target="_blank">Lab 2</a> if you don't remember how this works.<br><br>

    <b>Use 'TOUCH' Pins for Receiving:</b> Remember to use the pins with <code>TOUCHX</code> labels for better signal quality but do not use the one pin labeled as pin0 (TOUCH1) as receiver (you can still use it as sender). Below is the <code>ESP pin out</code> for your reference.<span style="color:red">Faraz: Check if this is still correct with the new ESP32</span><br><br>
    
<img src="images/lab2/esp32.png" width="750px" /><br><br>

<h3 id="2">(2) Extend Microcontroller Code to Read Slider Segments</h3>

<b>Read Slider Segment Signal Values:</b> Once finished with the wiring, extend your Arduino code to also read each slider segment's raw touch signal.<br><br>

<b>Plot each Signal Value to the Serial Plotter:</b> Next, serial print the received raw touch signals for each slider segment and look at them in the Serial plotter. To visualize only the slider touch signals in the serial plotter, you have to format the serial output in the same way as you did in lab 2:<br><br>
<pre><code>sliderValue1, sliderValue2, sliderValue3, sliderValue4, sliderValue5;</code></pre>
Don't forget to <code>Serial.print()</code> the <code>new line character "\n"</code> at the end of the line.

<!-- <span style="color:red">slider1","slider2","slider3","slider4","slider5""newline" (really? where is the semicolin? do we really need the </span>  -->

Below you can see the serial plotter output for individually touching each of the five slider segments one after another.<br><br>
<img src="images/lab4/lab2-slider-segments-raw-value.png" width="400px" /><br><br>


<h3 id="3">(3) Measure Min and Max Signal Thresholds</h3>

<b>Discrete vs. Continuous Touch Detection:</b> For the <code>touch buttons</code>, we were merely interested if the button is touched or not. Thus, we converted the touch signal into a <code>binary value 0 or 1</code>. For the <code>slider</code>, we want to compute at which position on the slider the finger is, i.e. we want a <code>continuous value</code>. This will allow us to more smoothly adjust the music volume rather than jumping from one discrete volume level to the next.<br><br> 

<b>How can we detect where the finger is on the slider?</b> To determine where the finger is on the slider, we need to detect <code>how much of each slider segment is touched.</code> When looking at a slider segment signal in the Serial Plotter, you will notice that the <code>value of a slider segment has a strong correlation with how much area of the slider segment is touched</code>, i.e. the more area your finger covers on the slider segment the higher the value is. Below, we are plotting the signal from the middle slider segment. You can see that the signal is first low because the finger is at the beginning of the slider and not touching the middle segment. As the finger moves towards the middle segment the signal goes up as the overlap area with the finger increases and then goes down once the finger passes it and the overlap area with the finger decreases again.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab2/2021_images/combined-gif.gif" width="750px"><br>
<img src="images/lab2/2021_images/touchsignal_labeled.png" width="750px"><br><br>

Before we can determine <code>how much</code> a slider segment is touched, we need to do some preprocessing. You need to repeat the next steps for <code>each slider segment individually</code> since they all have different noise levels and touch signal values due to slight inconstencies in the printing process.<br><br>

<b>Remove Noise:</b> First, we want to distinguish between noise (i.e. small signal readings when nothing is actually touched) and the value when one segment is just barely touched. To find this <code>minimum threshold</code>, open the Serial Plotter and slide with your finger over the segment you want to measure. At some point, you will see that the values will start increasing. Write down the <code>minimum value</code> which is consistently above the noise level. <code>Repeat</code> this procedure for each segment and write down the individual minimum values for each slider segment.<br><br>

<b>Determine Max Value when Slider Segment is Fully Touched:</b> Next, determine the <code>maximum value</code> when the slider segment is fully touched with you finger, i.e. your finger overlaps with the entire slider segment. <code>Repeat</code> the procedure for each slider segment and write down the value for each slider segment.<br><br>
    
<b>Add min and max threshold to your code:</b> Create two integer arrays Min and Max that contain the min and max values that you measured for each slider element. The size of both arrays should be 5 because we have 5 segments.<br><br>


<h3 id="4">(4) Compute Relative Position of Finger</h3>
    
    
There are two things that can happen when you slide with your finger over the slider: (1) Only one segment is touched at a time, or (2) two segments are touched at the same time. For (2), we want to interpolate between both touch sensor values to determine the relative position of the finger between these two segments, which we look at in the next step.<br><br>
    
<b>Compute relative position of a finger:</b>There are two things that can happen when you slide with your finger over the slider: (1) Only one segment is touched at a time, or (2) two segments are touched at the same time. For (2), we want to interpolate between both touch sensor values to determine the relative position of the finger between these two segments, which we look at in the next step.<br><br>
    
Now, let's create a function that computes the relative position of a finger <b>between</b> two slider segments. The function should read in two sensor signals and the two sensorIDs of the touched segments and it sould return a float between 0..1 that represents the relative position of the finger between two segements (0:left segment, 1:right segment).<br>
Compute the fraction of the received sensor signal compared to its corresponding max value: frac1 = sensor1/MAXsensor1 and frac2 = sensor2/MAXsensor2. These are the estimates of the relative finger position from each slider segment. Finally, compute an average between both values. Be aware that moving the finger to the right means that slider1 will drop in value and slider2 will increase in value. Thus, compute the relative averaged finger position as res = ((1-frac1)+frac2)/2. This is the return value of your function.

<h3 id="5">(5) Compute Overall Slider Value</h3>
    
The task here is to extend the code to compute the finger position on all 5 slider segments.<br><br>
    
<b>Identify if two slider segments are touched</b><br>
Implement an if statement that constantly checks if two slider segments exceed their min threshold at the same time. In that case, we can assume that a finger is touching 2 slider segments and you can pass over the received signals and slider segments IDs to the function you created in the previous step.<br><br>
    
<b>Compute the relative position of a finger</b><br>
You should receive from your function of the previous step a value between 0 and 1. To convert this value to a position on the whole slider segment, you have to to take into account the position of the touched slider segments. For example, if slider segment 3 and 4 are touched, the values should range between 0.5 and 0.75. Thus, we first have to scale down the returned value of the function to 0.25 by multiplying 0.25*res. The range of the return value will now be between 0 and 0.25. Next, we have to add the relative position. If slider 3 and 4 are active, you have to add 0.5 to the function value. Altogether, the relative position can be computered as RelPos + 0.25*res. RelPos should be 0 for the first slider segment, 0.25 for the second and so on.<br><br>
    
<img src="images/lab2/slider_vis_continuous.png" width="400px"><br><br>
    
<b>Identify if only on slider segment is touched</b><br>
In case only one slider segment exceeds its MinThreshold, you can simply compute the the discrete position on the whole slider. This would be the Relpos value of the previous paragraph. For example, 0 for slider segment 1 or 0.25 for slider segment 2, and so on.<br><br>
    
<img src="images/lab2/slider_vis_discrete.png" width="400px">

<h3 id="6">(6) Write Slider Value to Serial Port</h3>

Write the slider value to the Serial port so that you can read it out later in Processing. For the calculated slider value, format the output like we did before for the touch button so that:<br>

<code>(sensor ID),(slider_value);</code><br><br>
    
(sensor ID) is 3, and represents the ID of the slider (we already used up sensor IDs 0, 1, 2 for the touch buttons).<br>
(slider_value) is ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 to indicate the overall slider position (music volume).<br><br>

A sample output hould look like:<br>
<pre><code>3,0.78;
3,0.86;
3,0.97; 
</code></pre> 
The output should print continuously as long as the slider is touched. <br>

<br>

<h3 id="7">(7) Add Slider to Card</h3>

Let's add the slider to the music card to control the music volume.<br> Open the music card code again.<br><br>

We already implemented a class 'Slider' for you.<br>
You can make a new slider with:<br><br>

<pre><span style="red">mySliders.add(new Slider(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y));</span></pre>

Please add one slider to the code, just like how you added the button. <br>
Add code to the draw() function to display the slider when it is not in "hide" mode.<br><br>

Your result should look like this.<br>
You should be able to control the slider by dragging your mouse (with left mouse button pressed): <br><br>

Dragging the mouse on the slider from left to right:<br>
<img src="images/lab4/lab2-volume-low_UI_new.png" width="350px">
<img src="images/lab4/lab2-volume-middle_UI_new.png" width="350px">
<!-- <img src="images/lab2-volume-high_UI.png" width="200px"> -->
<br><br>

<h4>Create Slider Events for the Music Volume Control</h4><br>

To create events on mouse drag, we need to implement several mouseDragged() events.<br>
We already did some parts of it for you in the code further down in the class.<br>
Please go ahead and extend the code so that it changes the music volume based on the slider level. <br>
You might find the following functions from the "Audio" and "Slider" classes useful: <br>
<br><pre>
music.changeVolume(double intensity);
Slider.getIntensity();</pre><br><br>

Once you finished your code, test if the music volume actually changes by first playing a song with the virtual touch button and then dragging the slider to adjust the music volume. If everything works, move on.<br><br>
    
<h4>Hide the Slider</h4><br>

Similar to the previously added buttons, you can hide the Slider by pressing the 'h' key on your keyboard while your program runs.<br>
If you want to see them again, press 's' (for show).<br><br>

<h3 id="8">(8) Connect Physical Music Card to Processing</h3>

Now that we can control the slider digitally, we also want to adjust the volume of the music from the physical card.<br><br>
Read in the Serial messages from your ESP32 that include the values for the finger position on the slider. Use these values to change the volume of the music and integrate it into the music card Processing Script.<br>

<img src="images/lab4/lab2-volume-low_new.png" width="350px">
<img src="images/lab4/lab2-volume-middle_new.png" width="350px">
<!-- <img src="images/lab2-volume-high_UI.png" width="200px"> -->
<br><br>

Now test if everything works by using your physical printed card to play/pause songs and the physical slider to adjust the music volume. If it works, congrats, you are done :)!<br><br>

In this lab series, you will create an interactive music card. Underneath the visual design, the music card has an inkjet printed circuit with touch buttons and a slider that allow the user to play songs and control the volume. The card is connected to a microcontroller for analyzing user input and then sends the signals to a program called Processing for visualizing user input on screen.<br><br>


<h4 class="medium.headline" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Use our design or make your own</h4><br>

You have the choice to either use our template design files or to make your own design. That means either using our card design (three notes + piano keyboard) or to make your own card design. If you are a beginner in electronics and fabrication, we recommend you go with the default design since it is the safest path to success. However, if you are a designer at heart and you have some prior knowledge in electronics and making, it may be more interesting for you to make your own. If you decide to make your own, please make sure you read ahead what's coming in lab 2/3/4. There is also the risk that your own design will have its own bugs that we are less knowledgable about. Below you see a custom design from 6.810 student Diego Pinochet from last year that  features a circular slider rather than a straight one and additinal input buttons for extra functionality.<br><br>
