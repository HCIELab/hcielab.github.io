        <h2 class="headline">Lab 15: Video Taking + Editing</h2>


Today, you are going to capture video material of your multi-touch pad and then cut it into a short video that you can use for your website or project portfolio. Below on the left is a student example from last year and below on the right is a video the teaching team made for the old multi-touch pad we did in previous years (FTIR technology).

			<li>the video story board (.pdf, .jpg, or .png)</li>
			<li>the video (.mov, max. 30MB), which should include:
				<ul>
			<li>a title screen that states what the video is (e.g., 'Multi-touch Pad') and who made it (i.e. your name)</li>
			<li>at least 3 shots of video cut together (shots are your choice, you can also include shots that show you build electronics on the breadboard, a scene in which you inkjet print, it doesn't have to be just the final touchpad)</li>

<h3 id="VIDEOSTORYBOARD">(1) Draw a Video Storyboard</h3>

Before you start taking video, it is a good idea to <code>plan</code> by making a <code>video storyboard</code>. 
Take a piece of paper and <code>sketch out the scenes</code> you are planning to shoot.<br>

<b>What do you want to show in which scene?</b> It is up to you what you want to show in your video. It could only be the final <code>multi-touch pad</code> with the <code>signal plotter, blob detection, or pressure visualization</code> showing in the background. Or you could also show <code>what components the multi-touch pad is made of</code> showing the printed electrode matrix and the breadboard with close-ups. You could also show <code>how you made your multi-touch pad</code> by including a shot showing the inkjet printer printing it out, or showing how you add parts to the breadboard. No need to show all of these but you should spend a moment to think about what you want to highlight in your video.<br><br>

<b>What would you label in the video sequence?</b> It is also important to think about what you would like to <code>label in each video scene</code>. For instance, do you want to add some text on screen that points at the printed multi-touch pad and says 'multi-touch pad made from inkjet printed electrodes'? If yes, you need to think about where this text will be on screen and when you shoot your video you need to <code>make sure there is space</code> so you can place the text there later. <br><br>

<b>Which text will be on a black bar at the bottom?</b> Perhaps you also plan to use a <code>black text bar</code> at the bottom of the video screen like we did in the video on the top right. If you plan to do this, make sure that when you capture video you <code>leave some space at the bottom</code> so your multi-touch pad will not be covered by the bar.<br><br>

Here is an early storyboard example that we started drawing before we created our touchpad video:<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/drawn-storyboard.jpg" width="543px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> <br><br>

<b>Hand-Drawn vs. Photo Storyboard:</b> Storyboards do not necessarily have to be <code>hand-drawn</code> but it's typically the fastest. Alternatively, you can also create storyboards using photos and screenshots. For instance, you could quickly take photos of the different multi-touch pad scenes and also insert some screenshots from your Processing output in the storyboard. Below is an example of how this can look like using the FTIR touch pad:<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/picture-storyboard.jpg" width="543px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

<h3 id="SHOOTVIDEO">(2) Shoot Video</h3>

With your storyboard ready, you are now ready to shoot the video scenes.<br>
Read the tips below before you get started.<br>
<br>

<b>Clean Background</b><br>
Same as with the photos, use a clean backdrop and make sure there is no crap in the image that shouldn't be there.

<br><br>
<b>Never Zoom</b><br>
Yes, you can zoom to find a good image frame *before* you start recording, but *after* you hit the record button you should never ever zoom. Video material that uses zooming will immediately make you look unprofessional. The reason for this is that the very act of zooming has no equivalent in the human eye (our eyes cannot zoom in and out) and thus the material will always look unnatural.
<br><br>

<b>Always use a tripod</b><br>

Please always use a tripod, otherwise your video will be shaky.<br>
Make sure the water balance is leveled. <br><br>

<span style="color:red">We bought these tripods for class, they should fit all standard cell phones. Please use them! They are in the gray cabinet. </span>
<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/tripod1.png" width="283px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/video-editing/tripod2.png" width="263px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 


<br><br>

<b>Shoot every scene multiple times</b><br>

I always shoot every scene 3 times just in case something went wrong and I didn't notice. I also ideally slightly vary the action (e.g. come into the frame with the finger a little steeper or flatter so you have some choice of what you want to use in the end). <br><br>

<b>Keep the placement of sub-titles and labels in mind!</b><br>
Keep in mind you may put subtitles in the lower half of the video later on.<br>
If you planned to put labels somewhere, did you leave enough space in the frame? <br> Planning is key here to avoid major frustration later on.

<br><br>

<h3>(4) Edit Video (use Adobe Premiere or ShotCut)</h3>

Because MIT offers the Adobe Suite for free, you should be able to use <a href="https://www.adobe.com/downloads.html">Adobe Premiere</a> for video editing, which is what is also used in industry. Alternatively, you can also install <a href="https://shotcut.org/download/" style="color:red">Shotcut, a free open-source program</a>, the instructions for how to use it are further down on this page.<br><br>

<h3>Adobe Premiere Pro</h3>

<a href="images/video-editing/example-premiere-project.zip" style="color:red">To get started, download this template project here</a>.

<br><br>

After opening the Premiere Project file, you should see something like this:
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/premiere-interface.png" width="783px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

<h4>Adding your Video Material</h4><br>

In the first step, drag some of your video material (or a photo) onto the video timeline here.
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/video-timeline.png" width="783px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

The video timeline has multiple 'tracks' (layers).<br>
If you don't see your video material in the top window after you dragged it on the timeline, there is probably something else on top that covers it up.<br>
<br>

<h4>Cutting Video Material</h4><br>

You can either just drag the end of a clip to make it shorter.<br>
Or you can use the razor tool to cut a clip into two halfs (select the razor tool, then click onto the video clip in the location where you want to split it).<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/cutting1.png" width="383px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

<h4>Adding Text, Outlines, etc.</h4><br>

You can drag almost any file type onto the timeline (e.g. .jpg files, .ai files from Illustrator).<br>
I typically create my text in Illustrator, then drag the Illustrator file onto the timeline (if you do not have Illustrator, you can also use a different drawing program like inkscape or gimp).
<br><br>

This black-text-overlay.ai Illustrator file on the timeline (also in the example project folder) corresponds to the '6.810 Engineering Interactive Technologies - Multi-Touch Pad' text.
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-text1.png" width="353px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-text2.png" width="333px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

To edit it, I right-click onto the black-text-overlay.ai on the timeline and then click 'Edit Original', which opens the file in Illustrator. <br>

In Illustrator I change the file, save it, and when I go back to Premiere it will update automatically (see below).<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-text3.png" width="383px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-text4.png" width="293px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

In the same way, you can add any type of drawing onto your video.<br>
Here I drew a dotted white outline in Illustrator that highlights the touchpad and then overlaid it with the video file (see below).<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-outlines1.png" width="693px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-outlines2.png" width="693px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

<h4>Moving and Scaling Elements</h4><br>

If you are not happy with the placement of the text, you can also move it around in Premiere or scale it by going to 'Effects Controls' and then change the slider values under position and scale. 

<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/move-and-scale1.png" width="793px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>
Changing the position of the black title bar:
<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/move-and-scale2.png" width="793px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

And making it bigger:

<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/move-and-scale3.png" width="793px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

You can do the same thing with any element in the video timeline, such as the photo of the touchpad.<br>
Here I first double clicked the opening photo, then used scale to make the photo smaller and position to move it above the text.<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/move-and-scale4.png" width="793px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

<h4>Dip to Black, Cross-Dissolve and other Transitions</h4><br>

Transitions are really useful when you have a logical break, e.g. you show the blob detection and have multiple scenes about it, and then afterwards you show the gesture detection with multiple scenes. In-between these two steps it would be good to add a dip to black or other transition to show to the viewer that a new chapter starts.
<br><br>

To do this, click on 'Effects', then 'Video Transitions' and then drag e.g. the Dip to Black' between two video-snippets on the timeline.
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/transitions1.png" width="793px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>
Which should give you something like this:
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/transitions2.png" width="213px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/video-editing/transitions3.png" width="223px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/video-editing/transitions4.png" width="226px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> <br><br>

<h3>Shotcut</h3>
If you do not yet have Shotcut, you can download it <a href="https://shotcut.org/download/" style="color:red">here</a>.

<br><br>
<a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/hcie/files/classes/engineering-interactive-technologies/class-files/Shotcut-Example.zip" style="color:red">To get started, download this template project here</a>.

<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/shotcut-main-disp-commented.png" width="750px" style="border:1px solid grey" />
<br><br>
<h4>Adding your Video Material</h4><br>
To get started with Shotcut you should know two things. When you first open the software, you will notice that the window is split into a few regions. On the left there is column interface. Choose the playlist tab to view, add, or remove media files from the project.

<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/shotcut-sidebar-commented.png" width="500px" style="border:1px solid grey" />
<br><br>

The bottom region is used to organize and stitch media together in tracks. Here you can start a track by clicking on the icon below 'Timeline':
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/shotcut-timeline10.png" width="300px" style="border:1px solid grey" />
<br><br>
and then selecting if you want to add an audio or a video track.
<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/shotcut-add-tracks.png" width="500px" style="border:1px solid grey" />
<br><br>

Once you have a track just drag and drop files from your playlist into the track you want.

<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/shotcut-track-commented.png" width="500px" style="border:1px solid grey" />
<br><br>

<h4>Cutting Video Material</h4><br>

You can either just drag the end of a clip to make it shorter.<br>
Or you can use the 'Split at Playhead' tool to cut a clip into two halfs (move the playhead at the location you want to cut, then click on the tool).<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/cutting-shotcut1.png" width="383px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/video-editing/cutting-shotcut2.png" width="383px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

<h4>Adding Text, Outlines, etc.</h4><br>
Shotcut allows you to add various effects to your media. This includes text, fading in and out, etc. Here is a basic video about various filters.

<br><br>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Um8GlZeF9gg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br><br>
<h4>Other helpful information</h4><br>
<ul>
    <li>If you drag one clip into another clip on the same track, they will automatically fade together. </li>
    <li>You can use the 's' key to automatically split a clip.</li>
    <li>All clips you add to a track can also be shortened by dragging handles at the beginning or end of the track</li>
    <li>You can have multiple video tracks to create interesting effects like videos within videos, or videos in static images.</li>
    <li>You can adjust the speed of a clip by selecting the clip and selecting the "Properties" button at the top menu bar. There should be a settable "speed parameter.</li>
    <li>You can export videos by navigating "File->Export Video..." There are several options. I selected "H.264 High Profile" and pressed the "Export File" button.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(5) Add Music</h3>

Videos are often more fun with music.<br>
Websites, <a href="https://www.jamendo.com/">such as Jamendo.com,</a> provide many free sound files as long as you distribute your own work under creative commons license as well. <br>
Otherwise you might have to pay, depending on the platform you use.<br><br>
