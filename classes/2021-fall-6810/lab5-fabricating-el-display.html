        <h2 class="headline">Spraying Electroluminescent Displays</h2>
      
        <hr>

        In the next two labs, we will build an interactive mug. It can sense its own temperature and display how hot it is with an electroluminescent display.<br><br>

    In this lab, you will make the display yourself from scratch using airbrushing.<br>
    Next lab, you will inkjet print the remaining circuit and assemble the remaining parts of the design.<br>

<h2 class="headline">Deliverables Lab 3 (due Friday, Sept. 25, 2020, 11.59pm)</h2>

At the end of Lab 3, upload to your student google drive:
<ul>
  <li>the Arduino code (.ino) for dimming your display</li>
  <li>2-3 photos (.jpg or .png) from different angles of your circuit</li>
  <li>a short video (.mov or .mp4, max. 1 minute) showing how you display dims and performs a full cycle from bright to dark and dark to bright again</li>
</ul><br>


 <h3 class="headline">Your Task for Lab 3: <br>Fabrication and Control of Electroluminescent Displays</h3>
    
In lab 3, we will fabricate an electroluminescent display and build the controller circuit to turn it on and off.<br>
Recall from the 'display' lecture that electroluminescent displays consist of 4 layers: two conductive layers that sandwich the light emitting phosphor layer and the dieletric layer. The top conductive layer is a silver or copper layer. The bottom conductive layer is  transparent (ITO on transparent PET) otherwise you wouldn't be able to see the phosphor glow. To avoid shorts, the insulating dielectric layer prevents the two conductive layers from touching. And once you apply an AC on the two conductive layers, the resulting electric field between them will excite the phosphor and make it glow.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/el-display-flipped.png" width="600px"> <br>

<b>Making a Display of a Particular Shape</b><br>
We want to print a display shaped as a steaming coffee mug. <br>
To make your display have a particular shape, consider the following: The display will only glow in those area that both have a top electrode (ITO sheet) and bottom electrode (copper).<br>
Any area that only has a top electrode (ITO) but is not covered by the bottom electrode (copper) will not glow.<br>
Thus, in order to make our display have a certain shape, we actually only need to shape either the top OR the bottom electrode, and not both.<br><br>

For our display, we will shape the copper electrode by laser cutting a stencil, applying the stencil on the already sprayed layers of the EL display and then spraying the copper electrode using this stencil.<br>
Thus, only the areas where the copper passes through the stencil will make the display glow.<br>
Below you can see the stencil design we will use. As you can see, if contains several stencils in a row, this is because you will make 2 displays for each team member (8 in total) to ensure that a good number of them work and you will be able to take a working display home.<br><br>
    
 <img src="images/lab5/lab3-stencil-file-overview-mirrored.png" width="700px"><br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Fabricating the Display:<br> ITO, Phosphor, Dieletric, Copper</h3>

You will fabricate your display in teams.<br>
As a team of four students, each student will spray one layer for the team.<br>
So only if all team members do a good job, your display will be complete and hopefully work in the end.<br>
The reason we have each team member spray one layer for everyone rather than all layers for one-self is that after spraying one material, the airbrush has to be cleaned, which takes about 20 minutes, and the layer has to dry, which takes about 30 minutes. Thus, within the time frame we have in this class, having everyone spray all layers with all the cleaning and drying that is needed is not feasible (you would need ca. 4 hours per person to spray all layers).<br><br>

<h4>Decide Spray Order for your Team</h4><br>
If you haven't already, decide which team member is going to spray what.<br>
Enter the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1tPphBIo63SmezmlKeZRz67ut-IkMz1vIJ6as1dduW7k/edit?usp=sharing">team member's name and spray times here in this google spreadsheet</a>.<br><br>

The ITO coated PET is just a PET sheet that we will provide you.<br>
    <table border="1" style="width: 100%">
    <tr>
        <td style="width: 150px">Team Member 1</td>
        <td>Prepare Spray Base + Spray the first layer: Phosphor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="width: 150px">Team Member 2&amp;3</td>
        <td>Spray one pass each: Dielectric. We will do two passes on the dieletric to make sure it is really covering everything otherwise your display will short circuit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="width: 150px">Team Member 4</td>
        <td>Laser Cut the Stencil + Spray the last layer: Copper</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
<br>

Note that spraying a display is not easy and you need to take utmost care that you spray your layer according to the instructions we give.<br>
We will call it a success if 50% of your displays work, i.e. we will have you fabricate some extra just in case.<br><br>
    

<h3 class="headline">All Team Members: Read Spraying How-To</h3><br>

Before your team comes in for spraying, please make sure you read the following tutorials:<br><br>

<ul>
  <li><a href="tutorial-preparing-spray-inks.html">preparing the spray inks</a></li>
  <li><a href="tutorial-safety-wear-and-spraying.html">safety wear and spraying</a></li>
  <li><a href="tutorial-cleaning-airbrush.html">cleaning the airbrush</a></li>
</ul><br>

We will show you most of this when you come in to spray, but please familiarize yourself with the spraying process so you have a rough idea what's coming.<br>

For spraying, we will have a compressor that creates air pressure and a spraygun, which is connected to the compressor, ready for you.<br><br>

 <img src="images/lab5/compressor.jpg" width="200px"> 
 <img src="images/lab5/airbrush.jpg" width="400px"> <br><br>


<h3 class="headline">Team Member 1: Prepare ITO and Spray Phosphor Layer</h3>

We will do this together when you come in for your spray time.<br>
Before we can spray the phosphor layer onto the ITO sheet, we have to do a few preparation steps.<br><br>

First, you need to cut a cardboard underlay for your ITO sheet.<br>
While spraying, you will hold onto the cardboard since you need to cover the entire ITO sheet with spray paint.<br>
Cut the cardboard into shape so that your ITO sheet can comfortable fit into the middle and you have enough space to hold the cardboard with your hand without touching the ITO.<br><br>

 <img src="images/lab5/lab3-prepare-cardboard-underlay.jpg" width="500px"> <br><br>

Before we can tape the ITO onto the cardboard, we first need to remove its protective cover foil.<br>
This needs a bit of fumbling but we trust you will be able to get it off.<br>
The ITO sheet is sensitive to bending so try to not bend the sheet too much while you try to pull off the cover foil.<br><br>

The ITO sheet is only conductive on one side (i.e. the side where we just removed the protective coating).<br> 
If you are unsure which side that was <b>use a multimeter to check which side is conductive.</b><br>
Imagine how frustrating it would be if all your team mates come in for spraying just to find out at the end you sprayed on the wrong side of the sheet and nothing will work!<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/lab3-remove-ITO-protective-cover.jpg" width="500px"> <br><br>

Once you know which side is conductive and needs to face up, you can attach the ITO sheet with tape to the cardboard.<br>
Tape around the entire area of the sheet, it will help you later to see where you already sprayed since you can monitor the marks on the blue area around the ITO. <br>
Try to not put too much tape on the ITO sheet itself since we need the entire ITO area for our displays.<br><br>

 <img src="images/lab5/lab3-attach-ITO-to-cardboard-with-tape.jpg" width="500px"> <br><br>

Before we start spraying, we need to tape off a strip at the bottom of each row of displays.<br>
We don't want any spray ink there since we will use this area to connect to our circuit later. <br>
Using regular transparent tape, tape of a strip on both the middle and the bottom of your ITO sheet.<br><br>

 <img src="images/lab5/lab3-taping-off-two-stripes.png" width="500px"> <br><br>

Next you can spray the phosphor.<br>
You will need to cover the entire area.<br>
We recommend doing a first pass vertically by moving the hand up and down and then a second pass horizontally moving left to right.<br> 
We want to make sure we have even coverage, if there is more phosphor in one area than another your display will have some brighter and some darker spots and will not be very even, so try your best to achieve even coverage.<br><br>
We will use a UV flashlight, which makes the phosphor glow, to better see where we already covered the surface sufficiently.<br><br>
Once you are done, we need to let the layer sit for at least 30 minutes to have it dry before your team mate can come in to spray the dieletric layer.<br><br>

 <img src="images/lab5/lab3-spraying-phosphor.jpg" width="262px"> 
 <img src="images/lab5/lab3-spraying-phosphor2.jpg" width="350px"> <br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Team Member 2 + 3: Spray Dieletric Layer Pass 1 and Pass 2</h3>

We will do this together when you come in for your spray time.<br>
Next, we will spray the dieletric layer.<br>
Again, we will cover the entire sheet with the dieletric material.<br><br>

Remember that the dieletric layer is super important.<br>
If the dieletric layer is not covering <b>every single pixel</b> there will be a short circuit in this area since the ITO sheet, phosphor layer, and copper layer (last layer) are all conductive and will touch each other and thus the display will not work.<br><br>

To ensure that the dieletric is really covering everything, we will apply two passes of dieletric, i.e. after one team member finished the dieletric and had it dry for 30 minutes we will have another team member come in to repeat the procedure.<br><br>

 <img src="images/lab5/spraying-dieletric.jpg" width="400px"><br><br> 

<h3 class="headline">Team Member 4: Laser Cut Stencil and Spray Copper Layer</h3>

<br>
<h4>Laser Cut the Stencil Before Coming in for Spraying</h4><br>

Before you come in for spraying, please make sure you have the laser cut stencil ready.<br><br>

<b>(1) Download the Stencil Design</b><br>
You can find the <a href="images/lab5/lc-template.pdf">stencil design file we prepared for you here.</a><br>
As you can see, if contains several stencils in a row, this is because you make 2 displays for each team member (8 in total) to ensure that a good number of them work and you will be able to take a working display home.<br><br>
    
<b>(2) Check Drawing Size and other Drawing Settings</b><br>

Next, open the file in your drawing program that you used for laser cutting your business card.<br>
Check if the stencil design has the right size.<br>
It should be 46mm x 46mm and show 8 little mugs and an outline around them.<br>
Also don't forget to check the <a href="tutorial-drawing-for-laser-cutting.html">other laser cutter drawing settings (line color, thickness) as described here.</a><br><br>
   
<!-- <img src="images/lab3/mug.png" width="200px">
<img src="images/lab3/ill_size.png" width="400px"> <br><br>
 -->
 <img src="images/lab5/lab3-stencil-file-overview-mirrored.png" width="700px"><br><br>

You may have noticed that the mugs are mirrored, i.e. the handle is on the left side not the right side.<br>
This is necessary because when we spray the stencil, it will form the bottom layer and the display will be flipped over in the end. Thus, if you forget about this (as we did initially) you will have the handle on the wrong side.<br><br>

<b>(3) Laser Cut your Stencil (Go to a Laser Cutter Office Hour)</b><br>

Go to one of the office hours this week and laser cut the stencil.<br>
If you need to remind yourself how the laser cutter works, <a href="tutorial-operating-the-laser-cutter.html">check this tutorial here again.</a><br><br>

Remember that the power/speed settings for cutting a material depend on the material type, i.e. which type of material it is and how thick it is.<br>
We will cut our stencil from an adhesive sheet.<br>
The adhesive part will make it easy to attach the stencil to the existing three display layers.<br>
The laser cutter settings are as follows: <b>power: 50%, speed: 100%</b><br>
z-axis should be turned 'off' and you should calibrate using the calibration stick in the laser cutter as shown by the workshop manager during the training.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/lab3-laser-cutting-power-speed-settings.jpg" width="500px">

<!-- <img src="images/lab3/lab3-laser-cutting-stencil-result.jpg" width="500px"> -->

<b>Spraying the Copper Layer:</b><br>

Before we can spray the copper layer, you need to apply the stencil (we will do this together when you come in for spraying).<br><br>

First peel the protective layer from the back side of the foil. <br>
The foil is adhesive on one side. <br>
Stick the stencil on top of the display sample.<br>
Make sure the stencil area with the display is not touching the transparent tape team member 1 taped onto the ITO sheet.<br>
Also make sure that your stencil covers the entire ITO sheet and there are no areas not covered by the stencil.<br>
When you apply the stencil, don't apply to much pressure so you don't damage the underlying layers.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/applying-stencil.jpg" width="500px"><br><br>

Next, spray the copper layer.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/spraying-copper.jpg" width="500px"><br><br>

Once the copper layer is sprayed, we let it dry a bit.<br><br>

Next, we want to remove the stencil and take the displays off the cardboard backing.<br>
Start by removing the stencil.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/removing-stencil1.jpg" width="360px">
<img src="images/lab5/removing-stencil2.jpg" width="265px"><br><br>

Next, peel off both the stripes of transparent tape.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/peeling-off-transparent-tape1.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/lab5/peeling-off-transparent-tape2.jpg" width="330px"><br><br>

Next, peel off the blue tape around the ITO sheet and take the display strip of the cardboard.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/peeling-off-blue-tape.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/lab5/displays-on-ITO.jpg" width="340px"><br><br>

Next, let's test how conductive the copper layer is from these two displays.<br>
This gives a good first estimate if the display will work or not.<br>
As in lab 1, use a multimeter and check if the layer is conductive.<br> 
The tips of the multimeter are quite pointy and you can damage the layers if you press too harshly on the copper, so be gentle.<br>
A good resistance would be around 10&#8486;.<br>
Anything higher than 50&#8486; that will likely not work.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/measuring-display-resistance.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>


Now that we have the displays, we want to power them up.<br>
As you can see below, to power them up we need to connect two wires, one to the ITO layer and one to the copper layer, i..e one for GND and one for power.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/el-display-wires.png" width="600px"><br><br>

To connect to the ITO layer, we attach copper tape to the ITO sheet and we can later use a crocodile clamp to connect to it.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/attaching-copper-tape.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/lab5/attaching-copper-tape2.jpg" width="320px"><br><br>


Before we connect to the copper layer, let's cut the displays into individual displays first.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/cutting-displays1.jpg" width="390px">
<img src="images/lab5/cutting-displays2.jpg" width="260px"><br><br>

Now we can connect to the copper layer. <br>
For this, we attach a small copper tape flap, which we can again later use with a crocodile clamp.<br>
Make the copper flap cover a larger area of the coffee mug display to ensure a good connection.<br><br>

<img src="images/lab5/making-copper-flaps.jpg" width="350px">
<img src="images/lab5/flipping-display.jpg" width="330px"><br><br>

Once we tested all your displays, you can either put them into your team storage at the IDC for everyone to pick up by themselves or bring them to your team mates. <br><br>
