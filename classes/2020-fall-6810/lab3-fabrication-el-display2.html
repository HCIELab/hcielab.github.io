<h3 class="headline">Powering Your EL Display</h3>

EL displays require an alternating current between the two elecrodes to excite the phosphor and make it light up.<br>
Therefore, just connecting it to a DC power supply, like the 3.3V DC from your ESP32, won't do the trick.<br><br>

We therefore use an inverter to generate 110V AC from your 3.3V DC ESP32 power supply.<br>
The 110V are low current and not really dangerous, but you can get a shock when you touch both electrodes.<br><br>

<span style="color:red">While building your circuit, you must adhere to the following rules:
<ul>
  <li>never touch the display or any part of the circuit while your microcontroller is connected to power</li>
  <li>unplug the microcontroller from your laptop <b>before</b> you do any wiring, only after it is unplugged you are allowed to touch the circuit and exchange wires and components</li>
  <li>once you are done wiring and you have made sure you are not touching any part of the circuit anymore, plug the microcontroller back in</li>
</ul>
</span><br>

<img src="images/lab3/inverter.png" width="400px"><br><br>

Your first step is to connect the 110V AC inverter output to the display.<br> 
Use two jumper wires and stick them into the white connector of the black output wires of the inverter.<br> 
The other end of the jumper wires then goes onto a crocodile clamp each.<br>
The crocodile clamps can then connect to the copper flaps of your display (one goes to the top flap and one to the bottom flap).<br> 
Be careful that you don't rip off the flaps when working with the wires.<br><br>

Next, you have to connect the inverter to the 3.3V power supply of your microcontroller.<br>
Use two jumper wires again to stick them into the white connector of the red/black wire of the interverter.<br> 
Let's keep the convention that black wires are GND and red wires are +3.3V.<br>
Next connect the red wire to your microcontrollers 3.3V and and black to the ESP32's GND.<br><br>

Once you are done wiring, turn the display around such that you see the top side. <br>
The copper should be on the bottom now and you can't see it anymore. <br><br>

When this is done, make sure you are not touching the circuit anymore at any place.<br>
Then plug your ESP microcontroller into your computer. <br>
You should see a bright EL display in the shape of the coffee mug now. <br>
If you see that, congratulations. <br>
If not, check if all wires are connected properly or ask for some help from the TAs.<br><br>

Replace the digitalWrite command with these two commands: <span style="color:red">students know PWM from 6.08, so we could just have them do it themselves.</span><br><br>
    <pre>// the number of the LED pin
const int ledPin = 16;  // 16 corresponds to GPIO16

// setting PWM properties
const int freq = 5000;
const int ledChannel = 0;

void setup(){
  // configure LED PWM functionalitites
  ledcSetup(ledChannel, freq, resolution);
  
  // attach the channel to the GPIO to be controlled
  ledcAttachPin(ledPin, ledChannel);
}
 
void loop(){
  // increase the LED brightness
  for(int dutyCycle = 0; dutyCycle <= 255; dutyCycle++){   
    // changing the LED brightness with PWM
    ledcWrite(ledChannel, dutyCycle);
    delay(15);
  }

  // decrease the LED brightness
  for(int dutyCycle = 255; dutyCycle >= 0; dutyCycle--){
    // changing the LED brightness with PWM
    ledcWrite(ledChannel, dutyCycle);   
    delay(15);
  }
}</pre>

 <h3 class="headline">Safety</h3><br>

<b>Skin Safety of Materials</b>: We use materials for the substrate and traces that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)for safe usage on human skin. To minimize the possibility of negative skin-reaction, we use only commercially available temporary tattoo paper as the substrate, and amedical electrode grade silver screen-printing ink as the conductive material for the circuitry.<br><br>

<b>Amount of Current</b>: We are only going to use the output of the ESP32 (5V) for our devices. Since skin has a high resistance, the current is naturally limited and is considered physiologically safe for humans. At no point are you allowed to use anything else to connect to your on-skin device than the ESP32 we provided you.<br><br>

<b>Body Location</b>: You are only allowed to apply the tattoo to your fore arm. Do not apply it in other body locations, such as the chest.<br><br>

If you do not feel comfortable applying the tattoo to your skin, you can also apply it to an object in your surrounding and if that's not available, you can also apply it to a piece of paper. If you have any questions, please contact the teaching team.<br><br>

<b>we decided against fabricating the Skintillates devices with inkjet printing because of the lack of data in the safety and long-term biocompatibility of these inks. also check the silver pen.</b> -->

<b>Blending the Art and Conductive Layer:</b> see below, (a) A dark colored pattern is printed on the art layer to completely cover the conductive layer, b) A lighter gradient color is printed on the art layer to allow the shape and silver color of the conductive layer to peek through, c) The pattern of the conductive layer is designed to complement the blue flower printed on the art layer, d) The silver conductive layer can be designed to be a design element. <br>

<!-- 
We first need to create the aesthetic and circuit design for our on-body user interface.<br>
We will first only do the menu, and then do the bend sensor later.<br>
In particular, our menu should have 6 buttons that have the following functions: XX, YY, ZZ.<br>
We will also include one LED <a href="https://chibitronics.myshopify.com/collections/getting-started/products/red-yellow-and-blue-megapack-circuit-stickers">(see Chibitronics LED in your package)</a> to show that the Tattoo is working.<br>
Make sure you also plan where the ESP will connect, i.e. you need to have sufficiently large connector pads (1cm x 1cm) for each wire coming from a button.<br>
Note that you can cover parts of the circuit design if you put the conductive traces underneath the design parts. <br>These parts will be hidden from the user's eye since the art layer will overlay them in the final tattoo.<br><br> -->



<!-- If you have a 2D printer at home, you can 2D print the visual design onto the tattoo transfer paper, so you can make a more complex design. Open your drawing program, and create the design. Note however, that you will need to hand-draw the conductive traces with the silver pen we provided you.<br><br>
 -->
<!-- If you don't have a 2D printer at home, you need to handdraw the design. To plan our your design, we recommend you either use a drawing program or a seperate piece of paper. You will use some color pens and the silver pen we provided you to draw your design.<br><br>
