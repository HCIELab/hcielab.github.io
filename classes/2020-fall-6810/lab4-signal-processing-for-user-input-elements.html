        <h2 class="headline">Building an Interactive Mug</h2>
In this lab, we will build an interactive mug that can sense its own temperature and signal the user if the content is too hot, too cold or just right. We will design an ink-jet printed temperature sensor to sense the heat of the mug and we will use the display which you sprayed in the last lab to signal to the user the current temperature of the mug's content.      
          <hr>

 <h3 class="headline">Your Task for Today</h3>
    You will create the interactive mug by following these steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Design an inkjet printed temperature sensor using Processing.</li>
        <li>Extend the inkjet printed temperature with wires to attach to your sprayed electrolumiscent (EL) display.</li>
        <li>Fabricate and assemble the printed circuit and EL display, then attach both to the mug.</li>
        <li>Build the circuit to read the temperature and control the EL display accordingly.</li>
        <li>Write the code that reads the mug's current temperature and that adjusts the brightness of the EL display accordingly, blinking when its contents are way too hot.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="headline">Deliverables Lab 4 (due Friday, Oct. 2, 2020, 11.59pm)</h3>
    
    At the end of Lab 4, upload to your student google drive:
    <ul>
        <li>the Processing code (.pde) to generate a temperature sensor</li>
        <li>the Arduino code (.ino) for controlling your display and reading the temperature</li>
        <li>2-3 photos (.jpg or .png) from different angles of your mug</li>
        <li>a short video (.mov or .mp4, max. 1 minute) showing how you display's brightness increases when pouring in boiling hot water. It should start blinking after a few seconds when the mug reaches a high enough temperature.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="headline">(1) Designing the inkjet printed temperature sensor</h3>

    First, you will use conductive inkjet printing to make your own temperature sensor from scratch.<br><br>

    <b>Why can conductive wires be used to sense temperature?</b><br>
    To sense temperature using conductive wires, you will make use of a material property that most conductive metals share. Their resistance increases at higher temperatures. The higher the resistance of the conductive wire, the more it will react to temperature changes.<br><br>

    <b>How can we create a high resistance in a conductive wire?</b><br>
    If you look at the image below, you can see that the resistance of a conductive wire is determined by its cross-section A and its length l. Note that when we talk about the cross-section A in our example here, we mean the width of the wire since the height will be the same for all our prints. <br> 
    To create a high resistance for our purposes, what can you say about the cross-section A and the length of the wire l? <br>
    Should they be larger or smaller?<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab4/resistance.png" width="400px"><br><br>

    To have a high resistance, the cross-section A (width of the wire) should be as small as possible, and the length of the wire should be as large as possible.<br> 
    The thermal resistivity p of the material of course also plays a role, i.e. the larger it is the higher the resistance, but since we print all our circuits with the same material, i.e. silver, we can't change it anyways so we can ignore it for now.
    <br><br>

    <b>How thin and how long should the wire be?</b><br>
    As you just figured out, the thinner and longer the conductive wire the higher the resistance, which helps us to sense temperature changes more precisely. Thus, a well designed temperature sensor should consist of a thin and long ink-jet printed silver trace <span style="color:red">such that small variations in resistance have a large effect on the overall resistance. (I don't understand this, shouldn't then a small resistance be better to begin with since changes have a larger effect?)</span><br><br>

    <i>Overall Resistance:</i> When writing this lab, we ran a few experiments and found that to work properly as a temperature sensor, our wire needs to have an overall resistance of 1kOhm.<br><br>

    <i>Smallest Thickness:</i>  We also found that the thinnest trace we can print is 0.3mm wide.
     Any thinner than this and the silver does not connect reliably anymore.<br><br> 
 
    <i>Resistance of a 1cm long trace:</i> When we print a trace of 0.3mm width and 1cm length, we find that it's resistance is 7.5 Ohm/cm.<br>
     Note that this can vary depending on the substrate, the 2D printer, and the silver ink mixture, so if you change any of these you would have to remeasure the resistance.<br><br> 

     <i>Required Length of the wire for 1kOhm?</i> Assuming that the thermal resistivity p and the height of the trace is constant, how long does your conductive wire have to be to have 1kOhm resistance?<br>

     <span style="color:red">Mh, how can we derive this from the formula above?</span><br>
     We can estimate the resistance of a trace of length l by calculating<br>
    
    <pre>resistance = l * 7.5 Ohm/cm</pre><br>


     <b>Shaping a long conductive wire into a compact form factor:</b><br>
    Now that we know how long the wire has to be, the next question that arises is how to best shape it to take up minimal space on our design? A classic method to create a long wire on a small area is to design it in a horse shoe pattern similar to this:<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab4/hsp.png" width="700px"><br><br>
       
    <b>Write Processing Script to generate line layout:</b><br>

    Since drawing this manually is quite the pain, we instead want to leverage our computational design capabilities in Processing. Write a Processing Script that generates a temperature sensor layout of variable length depending on a desired overall resistance. Reuse your code from pset1 to write this script. 

    In detail, the Processing script should have the following features:<br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>user input elements for line width (default: 0.3mm), overall resistance, and overall width of  temperature sensor (default: 7cm)</li>
        <li>generate a set of horizontal lines of the given width and connect them with vertical lines on alternating sides, the distance between each horizontal trace should be 0.5mm</li>
        <li>output a .pdf that contains the temperature sensor</li>
    </ol><br>
  
    Once you exported your pdf, you are ready to move onto the next step.<br><br>

    <h3 class="headline">(2) Extend Temperature Sensor Circuit with Wires<br> that Connect to EL display</h3>
    
    Now that we have our temperature sensor, it's time to plan how it will connect to the EL display so we can create the overall circuit layout that we want to attach to the mug. <br><br>

    Below, you see an image of the mug for reference. <br><br>

    <img src="images/lab4/mug.png" width="300px"><br><br>

    And further below you see an image of the overall circuit layout that fits onto the mug and has all the elements you need for the circuit.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab4/mugCircuit.PNG" width="700px"><br><br>

    The circuit includes:<br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>the temperature sensor near the mug's handle</li>
        <li>your sprayed EL display on the opposite side of the handle <span style="color:red">(no overlap with the temperature sensor)</span></li>
        <li>4 connector pads to connect your microcontroller to the mug's circuit <span style="color:red">(size of pads width+height?)</span></li>
        <li>2 printed wires that connect the temperature sensor to the connector pads <span style="color:red">(thickness of wires?)</span></li>
        <li>2 printed wires that connect the EL display to the connector pads (width a distance of a least 3cm at the location where they connect to the EL display to avoid shortcuts) <span style="color:red">(thickness of wires?)</span>. Note that the location of these wires depends on where you put the copper flap and copper strip onto your sprayed EL display. If they are not at the bottom of the display but instead at the top, you need to route one of the wires above the temperature sensors.
        </li>
    </ol><br>

  For the total size aim for 17cm width and 7.5cm height so that the final design will fit nicely on the mug.<br><br>
    
    
    <h3 class="headline">(3) Fabrication and Assembly of Circuit, EL display, and Mug</h3><br>

    Now that you have the design ready, you can come in for fabrication and assembly.<br><br>

    <b>Ink-jet print your circuit</b><br>
    Once you are done with your circuit design, please put it in your google drive, let us know on slack that you are ready for inkjet printing, and then book an OH slot.<br><br>

    <span style="color:red">Before you come to the OH, make sure that the wires to the EL display are at the right position for YOUR display and the temperature sensor does not overlap with the display. Please bring the EL display with you to the OH so we can double check everything there.</span><br><br>
    
    Also when you come in, please don't forget to pick up:<br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>the mug</li>
        <li><span style="color:red">a 1 kOhm resistor</span></li>
        <li>a roll of copper tape</li>
    </ol>

    <img src="images/lab4/copper-tape.png" width="300px"><br><br>

    <b>Test resistance of your temperature sensor</b><br>
    Once your print is done and before you continue with assembly, check if the temperature sensor has a high enough resistance.<br> 
    Use a multimeter and hold its two electrodes on the two corresponding connector pads (see image below).<br> 
    Hopefully you will read a value close to 1 kOhm.<br>
    If not, please let us know and we can help debug.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab4/testingTemperature.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>
    
    <b>Attach your sprayed EL Display on the Circuit</b><br>
    Once you have printed your circuit and verified that the temperature sensor is having the right resistance, you are ready to attach your EL display to it.<br><br>

    First lay your circuit on a flat surface.<br><br> 

    <span style="color:red">(image missing)</span><br> <br> 

    Take a roll of copper tape and cut of two 6cm long pieces.<br><br>

    <span style="color:red">(image missing)</span><br><br> 

    Glue one half of each copper stripe on the two <span style="color:red">(display?)</span> wires on your circuit and bend the other half around such that the adhesive side faces upwards <span style="color:red">(I'm not quite following what you are trying to do here, is this to make the display stick to the circuit? perhaps add some images?)</span>.<br><br> 

    <span style="color:red">(image missing)</span><br> <br> 

    Make sure that the two copper stripes don't connect to each other and have a save distance of at least 1cm. <br><br>

    Next, stick your display onto the bend-over copper stripes.<br>
    Make sure that one copper strip connects only to the ITO and the other copper strip only connects to the sprayed copper layer.<br><br>

     <span style="color:red">(image missing)</span><br> <br> 

    <b>Test Display Connection</b><br>

    Now, it's time to test if the connection between the display and the printed traces is working.<br>
    Take your battery and inverter circuit and connect it to the two connector pads on the left hand side of the circuit. <br>
    You should see that the display lights up.<br> 
    We will have an inverter and power supply at the OH, so you don't have to bring your own.<br><br>

    <span style="color:red">(image missing)</span><br> <br> 

    Once, you verified that everything works, you can tape the display on its edges onto the circuit sheet.<br> 
    Take some scotch tape and apply a stripe on the left and the right edge of your display.<br><br>

    <span style="color:red">(image missing of applying tape)</span><br> <br> 

    <b>Attaching the entire circuit to the mug</b><br>
    Now we are ready to attach the entire circuit to the mug.<br>
    For this, we will use double sided tape.<br>
    In the OH, cut off a tape strip the length of your circuit design, i.e. it should be 17cm and attach it across the surface of the mug.<br> 
    Next, also remove the protective foil from the tape such that it is also adhesive on the top side.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab4/attachingTape.jpg" width="257x">
    <img src="images/lab4/mugWithTape.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

    Now take your printed circuit and glue it onto your mug.<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab4/attachingUI.jpg" width="420x">
    <img src="images/lab4/attachedUI.jpg" width="280px"><br><br>
    
    <span style="color:red">Attaching the microcontroller...</span>

    <h3 class="headline">(4) Connecting to the Microcontroller and Building Remaining Circuit</h3><br>


    <h3 class="headline">(5) Code for Reading Mug's Current Temperature and Adjusting Display</h3><br>

    The display should be turned off when the mug is cold. It should increase its brightness up to approx. 70C and start blinking if it is too hot >70C. <br><br>

    Your final design should look like this:<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab4/interactiveMug.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

    <h3 class="headline">Deliverables Lab 4 (due Friday, Oct. 2, 2020, 11.59pm)</h3>
    
    At the end of Lab 4, upload to your student google drive:
