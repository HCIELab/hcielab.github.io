        <h2 class="headline">Electroluminescent Displays + Electronics on 3D Surfaces</h2>
      
        <hr>

        In the next two labs, we will build an interactive mug. It can sense its own temperature and display how hot it is with an electroluminescent display that we will print in this lab. The final product should look like this:<br><br>

    (insert picture of the mug here)<br><br>

    You will make the display yourself from scratch using airbrushing and inkjet print and assemble the rest of the design.<br><br>

 <h3 class="headline">Your Task for Lab 3: <br>Fabrication and Control of Electroluminescent Displays</h3>

    
In lab 3, we will focus on fabricating the electroluminescent display and building the controller circuit to turn it on and off.<br>
Recall from the 'display' lecture that electroluminescent displays consist of 4 layers: two conductive layers that sandwich the light emitting phosphor layer and the dieletric layer. The top conductive layer is transparent (ITO on transparent substrate) otherwise you wouldn't be able to see the phosphor glow. The bottom conductive layer is silver. To avoid shorts, the insulating dielectric layer prevents the two conductive layers from touching.<br><br>

When you look from the top, the display layers would look like this.<br><br>

<img src="images/el-display-top.png" width="600px"> <br><br>

However, for ease of fabrication, we will fabricate the display up-side-down, i.e., we will start with the ITO sheet (ITO on transparent substrate), then add the phosphor, then add the dielectric, then add the conductive copper last.<br><br>

 <img src="images/el-display-flipped.png" width="600px"> <br>

<h3 class="headline">Fabricating the Display:<br> ITO, Phosphor, Dieletric, Copper</h3>

You will fabricate your display in teams.<br>
As a team of four students, each student will spray one layer for the team.<br>
This means, student 1 sprays phosphor for each team members' display, student 2 will spray the dieletric on each team member's displays.<br>
So only if all team members do a good job, your display will actually work in the end.<br><br>

<h4>Decide Spray Order for your Team</h4><br>
If you haven't already, decide which team member is going to spray what.<br>
Enter the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1tPphBIo63SmezmlKeZRz67ut-IkMz1vIJ6as1dduW7k/edit?usp=sharing">team member's name and spray times here in this google spreadsheet</a>.<br><br>

The ITO layer is just a plastic sheet and we will give it to you.<br>
Team member 1 will spray phosphor as the first layer.<br> 
Team member 2 and 3 will spray a dieletric layer each (i.e., we will do two passes on the dieletric to make sure it is really covering everything otherwise your display will short circuit).<br>
Team member 4 will then spray the final copper layer.<br><br>

 <img src="images/el-display-flipped.png" width="600px"> <br>

Note that spraying a display is not easy and you need to take utmost care that you spray your layer according to the instructions we give.<br>
We will call it a success if 50% of your displays work, i.e. we will have you fabricate some extra just in case.<br><br>

<h4>Before Spraying the Last Layer: Laser Cut the Stencil</h4><br>

As you can see in the photo, we want to print a display shaped as a steaming coffee mug. <br>
To make your display have a particular shape, consider the following: The display will only glow in those area that both have a top electrode (ITO sheet) and bottom electrode (copper).<br>
Any area that only has a top electrode (ITO) but is not covered by the bottom electrode (copper) will not glow.<br>
This, in order to make our display have a certain shape, we actually only need to shape either the top OR the bottom electrode, and not for both.<br>
For our display, we will shape the bottom electrode (copper) by laser cutting a stencil and then using that stencil when we spray the copper.<br>
This only the areas where the copper and pass through the stencil will become part of the display and thus make it glow.<br><br>

<b>(1) Download the Stencil Design</b><br>
You can find the <span style="color:red"><a href="images/ito-sheet-template.pdf">stencil design file we prepared for you here.</a></span><br>
As you can see, if contains several stencils in a row, this is because you make 2 displays for each team member (8 in total) to ensure that a good number of them work and you will be able to take a working display home.<br><br>
    
<b>(2) Check Drawing Size and other Drawing Settings</b><br>

Next, open the file in your drawing program that you used for laser cutting your business card.<br>
Check if the stencil design has the right size.<br>
It should be <span style="color:red">2"x2", 5x5cm or 500x500 pixel and show 8 little mugs and an outline around them.</span><br><br>
   
<img src="images/lab3/mug.svg" width="200px">
<img src="images/lab3/ill_size.png" width="400px"> <br><br>

Also don't forget to check the <a href="tutorial-drawing-for-laser-cutting.html">other laser cutter drawing settings (line color, thickness) as described here.</a><br><br>

<b>(3) Material & Power and Speed Settings</b>

Remember that the power/speed settings for the laser cutter are material depending.<br>
We will cut our <span style="color:red">stencil from a transparent adhesive sheet, thickness 1mm.</span><br>
The adhesive part will make it easy to attach the stencil to the existing three display layers.<br>
The transparency will help us in seeing if we apply the stencil in the correct area.<br><br>

The <span style="color:red">power and speed settings are as follows.</span><br><br>

<b>(4) Laser Cut your Stencil (Go to a Laser Cutter Office Hour)</b><br>

Go to one of the laser cutting office hours this week and laser cut the stencil.<br>
If you need to remind yourself how the laser cutter work, <a href="tutorial-operating-the-laser-cutter.html">check this tutorial here again.</a><br><br>

<h4>Spraying the Phosphor and Dieletric Layers (Go to a Spraying Office Hour)</h4>

For the phosphor and dieletric layers, you will spray your entire strip from left to right.<br><br>

<h4>Spraying the Copper Layer (Go to a Spraying Office Hour)</h4>

Before we can spray the copper layer, you need to apply the stencil.<br>
First peel the protective layer from the back side of the foil. <br>
The foil should be adhesive on one side. <br>
Stick the stencil as good as you can on top of the display sample.<br>
Make sure that the cut out coffee mug covers the white areas completely.<br><br>

 <h4>Airbrushing Hardware</h4><br>

We will show you most of this when you come in to spray, but please familiarize yourself with the spraying process by reading the tutorial below. Also note that lab 3 continues further down below, i.e. you still need to wire up your display after you sprayed it.<br><br>

To airbrush, you need a compressor that creates air pressure and you need a spraygun, which is connected to the compressor.<br><br>

 <img src="images/compressor.jpg" width="200px"> 
 <img src="images/airbrush.jpg" width="300px"> <br><br>

 <h4>Safety Equipment</h4><br>

We will make you wear gloves, a disposable lab coat, and a disposable mask that filters out spray particles.<br>
Please keep the mask for later use in the semester.<br><br>

 <h4>Preparing the Spray Material (Shaking, Filtering)</h4><br>

First, you need some material for spraying.<br>
The inks we need come in these cans.<br>
Before you can use them, you need to shake the ink for at least 2-3 minutes.<br>
Otherwise the particles seperate and you will either clog the airbrush up or the sprayed liquid is not performing its function at all (e.g. if all copper particles are at the bottom of the can, the copper layer will not be conductive).<br>
Let's shake the can a bit.<br><br>

<img src="images/airbrush-sprayable-ink1.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/airbrush-sprayable-ink2.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

To double check that nothing is at the bottom of the can anymore, you can also use a wooden stick, put it inside the can and see how the consistency is when you pull it out. If you still see any particles or clumpy parts you definitely need to shake some more.<br>
Let's do that test.<br><br>

<img src="images/airbrush-testing-ink1.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/airbrush-testing-ink2.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

While we know you are the shake-master, we can still not 100% be sure that all the particles are dissolved.<br>
Therefore, we use a <span style="color:red">filter (XX micron)</span> to pour the ink through to make sure that really nothing enters the airbrush that shouldn't enter it.<br>
Before you use the filter, cut off the top area that you don't need and that makes the filter unnecessary bulky.<br>
We only need the part at the bottom that has the 'fabric' filter net.<br>
Fill the tank until about 2/3rds or less with ink.<br><br>

<img src="images/airbrush-adding-ink1.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/airbrush-adding-ink2.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/airbrush-adding-ink3.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

 <h4>Spraying</h4><br>

Now you are ready to spray.<br>
Turn on the compressor if it isn't on already.<br><br>

Push the button down to open the valve between the compressor and the airbrush.<br>
If you push the button down, you should feel air coming out from the front of the airbrush but no ink yet.<br>
Once you have confirmed that air is flowing, push the button down and slowly pull it back towards you. This will start the ink flow.<br>
The further you pull it towards you, the more ink will come out.<br>
For spraying functional inks, we always want to pull it back to the maximum.<br><br>

<img src="images/airbrush-buttons-explained.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

When you spray, you want to have even coverage.<br>
Aim for ca. 50% overlap between traces.<br>
You need to spray the entire surface first horizontally (left to right) and then afterwards also do a vertical pass (top to bottom).<br>
You need to repeat this at least 5 times to make sure the entire area is covered and there are e.g., no non-conductive patches.<br>
Also while you spray, make sure you have quite some distance between the airbrush and the object. If you are too close drops will from on the surface leading to uneven coverage.<br>
Use a multimeter to check of you reached sufficient conductivity.<br><br>

<img src="images/airbrush-spraying-conductive.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

Once you are done spraying, you need to let your object dry for at <span style="color:red">least 4 hours.</span><br>
After ca. 30 minutes, the ink will not smear anymore but it is not yet completely dry.<br><br>

Before you leave, make sure you turn off the compressor and most importantly, clean the airbrush (you don't have to do it this time since a fellow student from class is probably coming in soon).<br><br>

 <!--    Great you printed the silver onto the sample. It is still wet though and not conductive.<br>
    This ink needs thermal treatment to make the silver particles fuse together and become conductive. Take the heat gun in the workshop and set it to exactly 120C (250F). Heat the sample for about 3 minutes. <br><br>
 -->

<h3 class="headline">Testing if the Silver Layer is Conductive</h3>

 Once all four layers are sprayed, a good first test is to see if the copper layer is conductive. <br>
 As in lab 1, use a multimeter and check if the layer is conductive.<br> 
 You should read something around <span style="color:red">500ohm resistance</span>.<br><br>

Before you go back to your dorm room, the teaching team will also do a quick test to see if your display will light up. <br>
Please ask somebody to test it with you.<br>
You will later replicate the electronics when you are back in your dorm room.<br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Attaching Wires to your Display</h3>

To connect your display to a circuit, you will need some wires to your display.<br>
As you can see below, we need to find a way to attach two wires to the EL display: one to the silver layer and one to the ITO sheet (i.e. one for ground and one for power).<br>

<img src="images/el-display-wires.png" width="600px"><br><br>

To do this, take your EL display and put some copper tape on the silver (and only the silver) layer that you just sprayed.<br>
Leave a little flap that makes it easier to connect a crocodile connector to it. <br>
Now connect that crocodile clamp to one of the wires of the inverter, it doesn't matter which one.<br><br>

To connect the ITO sheet, look at your display again and you will see that the printed layers do not cover the entire sheet.<br>
There is a bar that is still transparent. <br>
This area allows us to get access to the ITO layer.<br> 
Attach some copper tape there, i.e. glue the tape over the entire bar such that it is completely covered and make it even a bit longer (about 1" (2.5cm).<br>
Next, connect a crocodile clamp to the copper tape and connect the other side of the crocodile clamp to the other side of the inverter.<br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Powering Your EL Display</h3>

Let's connect your display to a power supply, i.e. your ESP32 microcontroller, and light it up!<br>
EL displays require an alternating current between the two elecrodes to excite the phosphor and make it light up.<br>
Therefore, just connecting it to a <span style="color:red">DC power supply, like your ESP connected to a USB port,</span> won't do the trick.<br><br>

We therefore use an inverter to generate <span style="color:red">AC from your DC power supply</span>.<br>
<!-- <span style="color:red">Warning! The 110V are low current and not really dangerous, but they can give you an unpleasant shock.</span> Therefore, never plug the display in when the electrodes are exposed <span style="color:red">(what does this mean?)</span>. Also never hold the display in your hands when the electrodes are exposed and the display is plugged in!<br><br>
 -->    
There is a 3V inverter in your fabrication bag. <br>
<span style="color:red">Your first step is to connect the inverter to your power supply, i.e. GND and 3.3V from your ESP microcontroller.</span>.<br><br>

    (schematic here)<br><br>

Now that the power is connected to the inverter, the inverter still has to get connected to the EL display.<br>
Connect the inverter to the two crocodile clamps that are attached to your EL display.<br>

Turn the display around such that you see the top side. <br>
The silver should be on the bottom now and you can't see anymore. <br><br>

When this is done, plug your ESP microcontroller into your computer. <br>
You should see a bright EL display in the shape of the coffee mug now. <br>
If you see that, congratulations. <br>
If not, check if all wires are connected properly or ask for some help from the TAs.<br><br>
    
<h3 class="headline">Building the control circuit for EL Displays</h3>

So now you can turn on/off your display by plugging and unplugging it. 
That's ok but it would be nicer to do this via code from the microcontroller and not by physically plugging/unplugging the display.
The goal of this final part of the lab is to build a control circuit that lets you do exactly this. <br><br>

The ESP32 microcontroller does not have a suitable AC switch built-in. Thus, we have to build our own. <br>
Our switch will consist of a <b>triac</b> and an <b>optocoupler</b>.<br><br>

A <b>triac</b> is similar to a transistor but also block alternating current (AC) while a transistor can only block direct current (DC). By switching the triac on/off, we can thus block the AC current coming from the power supply, which allows us to turn the display on/off under computer control. The triac's pins and how you add it to a circuit is similar to a transistor though. It has two connectors for + and GND and a Gate that can trigger it to let current pass through or block it. The symbol and a picture of the triac that we will use in this lab is below:<br><br>
    
<img src="images/lab3/Triac.png" width="100px"><img src="images/lab3/triac_image.png" width="200px"><br><br>
    
An <b>optocoupler</b>


Below you see the schematic of the circuit that can switch a low voltage AC circuit. The 3.3V comes from a pin of your ESP32. <br>
<img src="images/lab3/triac_circuit.PNG" width="500px"><br><br>
    
<span style="color:red">Most likely, you can spot already something dangerous here. Your low voltage ESP32 is directly connected to a 110V power supply which might possible burn your microcontroller (Stefanie: why is this connected?)</span>. To prevent this, we want to isolate the trigger circuit that controls the AC switch from the high voltage circuit. Luckily there exists a components that can do exactly that. It's also a (soemtimes) triac but instead of being triggered with a physical wire (Gate) it contains a LED and a photo-triac and both components are galvanically isolated. You can see how the symbol and the component looks like:<br><br>
    
<img src="images/lab3/opto_symbol.PNG" width="200px"><img src="images/lab3/opto_img.PNG" width="200px"><br><br>

The optocupler is controlled by the ESP32 and protects it from any high voltage and the optocoupler on the other hand can control the triac and open and close the AC switch. <br>
Bringing it all together, our AC switch circuit should look like this:<br><br>
    
<img src="images/lab3/optotriac_circuit.PNG" width="600px"><br><br>    

Get yourself a breadboard, wires and the components and start building it. You might have to find out which way around you have to add the optocoupler. Note the little dot on its top. Look at the datasheet where the pins are: <a href="https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/308/MOC3163M-D-1811983.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet</a><br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Write a Program to turn the Display On/Off</h3>

Now that we have wired up our control circuit, we still have to write the code for it.<br>
As an example, we will write a script that lets the display blink. <br>
This is very simple with the circuit you already built.<br>
Check again, to which pin you connected the optocoupler and us this pin to turn it on and off<br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Write a Program to Dim the Display</h3>

In addition, it would be nice to not just turn it on/off but also set the displays brightness (e.g. dimming it down).<br>

You can also dim it by using the PWM signal of the ESP pins. You already know from 6.08 how to create a PWM signal on a pin. Use it to let the display increase and decrease in brightness. The increase from 0% to 100% duty cycle should take 2 seconds and then dim it down again in another 2 seconds. And let it repeat this blinking infinitely.<br>
<!--
Replace the digitalWrite command with these two commands: <span style="color:red">students know PWM from 6.08, so we could just have them do it themselves.</span><br><br>
    <pre>// the number of the LED pin
const int ledPin = 16;  // 16 corresponds to GPIO16

// setting PWM properties
const int freq = 5000;
const int ledChannel = 0;
const int resolution = 8;
 
void setup(){
  // configure LED PWM functionalitites
  ledcSetup(ledChannel, freq, resolution);
  
  // attach the channel to the GPIO to be controlled
  ledcAttachPin(ledPin, ledChannel);
}
 
void loop(){
  // increase the LED brightness
  for(int dutyCycle = 0; dutyCycle <= 255; dutyCycle++){   
    // changing the LED brightness with PWM
    ledcWrite(ledChannel, dutyCycle);
    delay(15);
  }

  // decrease the LED brightness
  for(int dutyCycle = 255; dutyCycle >= 0; dutyCycle--){
    // changing the LED brightness with PWM
    ledcWrite(ledChannel, dutyCycle);   
    delay(15);
  }
}</pre>

 <h3 class="headline">More Information on Cleaning the Airbrush</h3><br>

You are done for this lab. <br>
If you are interested, below you find more information on how to clean the airbrush after and before a spraying session.<br><br>


 <h4>Extensive Cleaning the Airbrush</h4><br>

Before you can airbrush anything, you need to clean the airbrush.<br>
If the airbrush has not been used for 3 or more days, you need to perform the extensive cleaning as outlined below.<br>
If the airbrush was in use more recently, you can do the light cleaning procedure explained in the next section.<br><br>

First you need to screw off the back of the airbrush as shown below.<br><br>

 <img src="images/airbrush.jpg" width="300px">
 <img src="images/airbrush-remove-back.jpg" width="300px"> <br><br>

Also open up the metal screw at the back (check where the fingers are pointing.<br>
You don't have to remove it, but you need to open it so the needle (metal stick sticking out can move back and forth).<br>

 <img src="images/airbrush-remove-back.jpg" width="300px"> <br><br>

Next, screw off the front part of the airbrush like shown below.<br><br>

 <img src="images/airbrush-remove-front1.jpg" width="300px">
 <img src="images/airbrush-remove-front2.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

Also screw off the golden part from the front (compare the left and right image, see both components on the table in the back on the right image).<br><br>

<img src="images/airbrush-remove-front2.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/airbrush-remove-front3.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

Next, remove the needle from the airbrush casing.<br>
Depending on how dried out the inks were, the harder it may be to remove the needle.<br>
Hammer it on a covered surface to remove, but please only apply force on the backside not the front.<br><br>

<img src="images/airbrush-remove-needle1.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/airbrush-remove-needle2.jpg" width="300px"><br><br> 

Next, put some laquer thinner on a paper tissue.<br>
Rub the needle with the paper tissue. Only rub from one side, applying motion from the back (non-sharp) towards the front (sharp side). Never rub back and forth or you will hurt yourself with the needle tip.<br><br> 

<img src="images/airbrush-apply-lacquer-thinner1.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/airbrush-apply-lacquer-thinner2.jpg" width="300px"><br> <br> 

Put the needle aside and clean the back (Michael??) parts as well.<br>
For this, you first have to further disassemble them.<br><br> 

<img src="images/airbrush-clean-other-parts1.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/airbrush-clean-other-parts2.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/airbrush-clean-other-parts3.jpg" width="300px"><br><br> 

Once you have the three parts on the table as shown above, you can clean them.<br> 
For this, put a bit of laquer thinner into a cup.<br>
Then use the needle of the airbrush, dip it into the laquer thinner, and then insert the needle into the different components and rub it a bit around to remove any debris inside the part.<br>
If you have Qtips you can also use a Qtip.<br><br> 

<img src="images/airbrush-clean-other-parts4.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="images/airbrush-clean-other-parts5.jpg" width="300px"><br> <br> 

Now that you have everything cleaned, you need to put everything back together!<br> 
First insert the needle into the airbrush.<br> 
Then assemble and attach the front pieces.<br> 
Then assemble and attach the back piece and add the back enclosure.<br> <br> 


<h4>Light Cleaning the Airbrush</h4><br>

You need to perform this procedure if the airbrush was not used in the last 15 minutes but within the last 3 days (yes ink dries inside quickly).<br>
You also need to perform this procedure if you want to switch to a different ink.<br><br>

Before starting, turn on the compressor.<br>
First, fill some laquer thinner into the airbrush tank until about 2/3 full.<br><br>

<img src="images/airbrush-light-cleaning1.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

Next, press your finger onto the front of the airbrush where the air / ink normally exits.<br>
It's a good idea to use your non-dominant hand for this (i.e. if you hold the airbrush with your right hand, use the thumb of your left hand to close the front of the airbrush).<br>

<img src="images/airbrush-light-cleaning2.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

While pressing really hard with your thumb to keep the front of the airbrush closed, push down on the airbrush knob to open the air connection to the compressor. You should feel air pressing towards your thumb. Keep it closed.<br><br>

Now while carefully slowly pulling back on the airbrush knob, you will see that the laquer thinner in the tank will start to bubble. Slowly pull the airbrush know further back until you see a decent amount of bubbling. Hold everything in this position for about 1-2 minutes to give the tank a good cleaning.<br><br>

<img src="images/airbrush-light-cleaning3.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

Once you are done, turn off the compressor.<br>

If you do not feel comfortable applying the tattoo to your skin, you can also apply it to an object in your surrounding and if that's not available, you can also apply it to a piece of paper. If you have any questions, please contact the teaching team.<br><br>

<b>we decided against fabricating the Skintillates devices with inkjet printing because of the lack of data in the safety and long-term biocompatibility of these inks. also check the silver pen.</b> -->

<b>Blending the Art and Conductive Layer:</b> see below, (a) A dark colored pattern is printed on the art layer to completely cover the conductive layer, b) A lighter gradient color is printed on the art layer to allow the shape and silver color of the conductive layer to peek through, c) The pattern of the conductive layer is designed to complement the blue flower printed on the art layer, d) The silver conductive layer can be designed to be a design element. <br>

<!-- 
We first need to create the aesthetic and circuit design for our on-body user interface.<br>
We will first only do the menu, and then do the bend sensor later.<br>
In particular, our menu should have 6 buttons that have the following functions: XX, YY, ZZ.<br>
We will also include one LED <a href="https://chibitronics.myshopify.com/collections/getting-started/products/red-yellow-and-blue-megapack-circuit-stickers">(see Chibitronics LED in your package)</a> to show that the Tattoo is working.<br>
Make sure you also plan where the ESP will connect, i.e. you need to have sufficiently large connector pads (1cm x 1cm) for each wire coming from a button.<br>
Note that you can cover parts of the circuit design if you put the conductive traces underneath the design parts. <br>These parts will be hidden from the user's eye since the art layer will overlay them in the final tattoo.<br><br> -->



<!-- If you have a 2D printer at home, you can 2D print the visual design onto the tattoo transfer paper, so you can make a more complex design. Open your drawing program, and create the design. Note however, that you will need to hand-draw the conductive traces with the silver pen we provided you.<br><br>
 -->
<!-- If you don't have a 2D printer at home, you need to handdraw the design. To plan our your design, we recommend you either use a drawing program or a seperate piece of paper. You will use some color pens and the silver pen we provided you to draw your design.<br><br>
