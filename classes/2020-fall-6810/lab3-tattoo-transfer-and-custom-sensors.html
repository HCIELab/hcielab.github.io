        <h2 class="headline">Fabrication and Control of Electroluminescent Displays</h2>
      
          <hr>

 <h3 class="headline">Your Task for Today</h3>

In the next two labs, we will build an interactive mug. It can sense its own temperature and display how hot it is with an electroluminescent display that we will print in this lab. The final product should look like this:<br><br>

(insert picture of the mug here)<br><br>
    
For today, we will focus on printing the electroluminescent display and building the controller circuit to turn it on and off.<br>
Recall from lecture (insert which lecture) that electroluminescent displays consist of 4 layers: two conductive layers that sandwich the light emitting phosphor layer. To avoid shorts, we also have a insulating dielectric layer that prevents the two conductive layers from touch.<br><br>
    
We will use these materials to build a display today:<br>
    (1) transparent sheets coated with ITO.<br>
    (2) screen printed blue phosphor<br>
    (3) screen printed dielectric<br>
    (4) screen printed silver nano-particle ink as the bottom electrode<br><br>
    
We sent you two precoated sheets that already contain the ITO, phosphor, and insulator layer. Your task is to add the last missing layer: the silver conductor. The displays will only emit light in these areas where you print silver and will stay dark everywhere else.<br>

  <img src="images/lab3/EL_schematic.png" width="500px"> <br><br>
    
As you have seen in the photo, we want to print a display shaped as a steaming coffee mug. So, in order to give the display this shape, we will fabricate a stencil that will give the display its shape. Next, we will apply the stencil onto the sample that we sent you in your fabrication bags. And finally, we will screen print onto the stencils with conductive silver nano-particle ink. So, let's get started with fabricating the stencil.<br>
    
<h2>Preparing the display sample</h2>
    You will notice that the printed layers (white) do not cover the entire sample. There is a bar that is still transparent. This area allows us to get access to the ITO layer. We will connect our power supply to the ITO. The best way to do that here is to use copper tape.<br><br>
    Take the copper take from your fabrication bag and glue the tape over the entire bar such that it is completely covered and make it even a bit longer (about 1" (2.5cmn)). The copper tape connects to the ITO and we need this little flap to connect it to a power supply later in the tutorial.
    
<h2>Fabricating a stencil</h2>
    
This part of the tutorial involves laser cutting the stencil out of a transparent adhesive sheet. <br><br>
    
Step 1: Download the svg file of the coffee mug design here. (ask Ticha to make one)<br><br>
Next, open the file in your favorite vector design program (e.g. Adobe Illustrator, InkScape,...). We will show the rest of this lab with Illustrator but the basic operations are the same in each program. The mug should look like this:<br><br>
   
  <img src="images/lab3/mug.svg" width="200px"> <br><br>
    
Open the svg file and check if the mug design has the right size. It should be around 2"x2", 5x5cm or 500x500 pixel.<br><br>
    <img src="images/lab3/ill_size.png" width="200px"> <br><br>

Fun facts about laser cutting: A laser cutter operates in two different modes (1) raster, and (2) vector. In "Raster" mode, the laser moves from the top of the esign down to the bottom line by line, i.e. it does not follow the outlines of a shape. If we want the laser to follow the design's outline, we have to choose the "vector" mode. If you use a Universal laser cutter you have to do two things:<br><br>

First, you have to change the color of the outlines to red. Select all lines of the coffee mug and change their color to Red.<br><br>
    <img src="images/lab3/ill_color.png" width="300px"> <br><br>
Next, you have to set the line thickness. Set it to 0.001 (or hairline in other graphic editors).<br><br>
    <img src="images/lab3/ill_stroke.png" width="200px"> <br><br>
    
These two parameters tell the driver of the laser cutter to treat it as a vector and not as a rasterized image. Good!<br>
    Now, click on print and select the laser cutter as the printer. 
    
    (Add the other steps to laser cut a stencil here)
<h2>Applying the stencil on the El display sample</h2>
    Take the stencil out of the laser cutter. Next, we want to apply it onto our EL display sample. To this end, first peel the protective layer from the back side of the foil. The foil should be adhesive on one side. Now, try to stick the stencil as good as you can on top of the display sample. Make sure that the cut out coffee mug covers the white areas completely and don't cover the area where you put the copper tape before.<br><br>
<h2>Spray/Screen print the silver ink on your stencil</h2>
    Great you printed the silver onto the sample. It is still wet though and not conductive.<br>
    This ink needs thermal treatment to make the silver particles fuse together and become conductive. Take the heat gun in the workshop and set it to exactly 120C (250F). Heat the sample for about 3 minutes. <br><br>
    Next, we have to test if the silver is nice and conductive. As in lab 1, get a multimeter and check if the layer is conductive. You should read something around 1Ohm resistance.<br><br>
    Congratulations. You fabricated your first flexible electroluminescent display. Let's connect it to a power supply and light it up!
<h2>Connecting it to the Power Supply</h2>
EL displays require an alternating current between the two elecrodes to excite the phosphor and make it light up. Therfore, just connecting it to a 12V DC power supply won;t do the trick.<br><br>
    We use an inverter to generate 110V AC from a 12V DC power supply.<br><br>
    Warning! The 110V are low current and not really dangerous, but they can give you an unpleasant shock. Therfore, never plug it in when the electrodes are exposed our you hold the display in your hands! Trust me!<br><br>
    
    The inverter is in your fabrication bag. Take it out along with the 12V power supply that we also put in the bag. Your first step is to connect the inverter to the power supply (but leave the power supply unplugged).<br><br>
    (picture here)<br><br>
    
    Now, take your EL display and put some copper tape on the silver (and only the silver) layer that you just printed. Again, leave a little flap that makes it easier to connect a crocodile connector to it. <br><br>
    Next, take two crocodile wires and connect the two electrodes of your display to the two wires of the inverter. The order doesn't matter.<br><br>
    Turn the display around such that you see the top side. The silver should be on the bottom now and you can't see anymore. <br><br>
    When this is done, there is only one thing left. Plug in the power supply to your power outlet. You should see a bright EL display in the shape of the coffee mug now. If you see that, congratulations. If not, check if all wires are connected properly or ask for some help from the TAs.<br><br>
    
    <h2>Building the control circuit for EL Displays</h2>
    The goal of this final part of the lab is to build a control circuit that lets you turn on and off the display and even set it's brightness (e.g. dimming it down). The ESP32 does not have a suitable AC switch built-in. Thus, we have to build or own. We will use a Triac to switch it and an optocoupler to control the triac from the ESP32. Below you see the schematic of the circuit. Get yourself a breadboard, wires and the components and start building it.
    <h2>Write the controller program</h2>
    Great! We can now control EL displays with the pins of the microcontroller. Next, we have to write a script that lets the display blink. This is very simple with the circuit you already built. Check again, to which pin you connected the optocoupler and us digitalWrite(pin,HIGH) to turn it on, and digitalWrite(pin,LOW) to turn it off.<br><br>
    You can also dim it by using the PWM signal of the ESP pins. Replace the digitalWrite command with these two commands:<br><br>
    <pre>// the number of the LED pin
const int ledPin = 16;  // 16 corresponds to GPIO16

// setting PWM properties
const int freq = 5000;
const int ledChannel = 0;
const int resolution = 8;
 
void setup(){
  // configure LED PWM functionalitites
  ledcSetup(ledChannel, freq, resolution);
  
  // attach the channel to the GPIO to be controlled
  ledcAttachPin(ledPin, ledChannel);
}
 
void loop(){
  // increase the LED brightness
  for(int dutyCycle = 0; dutyCycle <= 255; dutyCycle++){   
    // changing the LED brightness with PWM
    ledcWrite(ledChannel, dutyCycle);
    delay(15);
  }

  // decrease the LED brightness
  for(int dutyCycle = 255; dutyCycle >= 0; dutyCycle--){
    // changing the LED brightness with PWM
    ledcWrite(ledChannel, dutyCycle);   
    delay(15);
  }
}</pre>

 <h3 class="headline">Safety</h3><br>

<b>Skin Safety of Materials</b>: We use materials for the substrate and traces that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)for safe usage on human skin. To minimize the possibility of negative skin-reaction, we use only commercially available temporary tattoo paper as the substrate, and amedical electrode grade silver screen-printing ink as the conductive material for the circuitry.<br><br>

<b>Amount of Current</b>: We are only going to use the output of the ESP32 (5V) for our devices. Since skin has a high resistance, the current is naturally limited and is considered physiologically safe for humans. At no point are you allowed to use anything else to connect to your on-skin device than the ESP32 we provided you.<br><br>

<b>Body Location</b>: You are only allowed to apply the tattoo to your fore arm. Do not apply it in other body locations, such as the chest.<br><br>

If you do not feel comfortable applying the tattoo to your skin, you can also apply it to an object in your surrounding and if that's not available, you can also apply it to a piece of paper. If you have any questions, please contact the teaching team.<br><br>

<b>we decided against fabricating the Skintillates devices with inkjet printing because of the lack of data in the safety and long-term biocompatibility of these inks. also check the silver pen.</b> -->

<!-- 
We first need to create the aesthetic and circuit design for our on-body user interface.<br>
We will first only do the menu, and then do the bend sensor later.<br>
In particular, our menu should have 6 buttons that have the following functions: XX, YY, ZZ.<br>
We will also include one LED <a href="https://chibitronics.myshopify.com/collections/getting-started/products/red-yellow-and-blue-megapack-circuit-stickers">(see Chibitronics LED in your package)</a> to show that the Tattoo is working.<br>
Make sure you also plan where the ESP will connect, i.e. you need to have sufficiently large connector pads (1cm x 1cm) for each wire coming from a button.<br>
Note that you can cover parts of the circuit design if you put the conductive traces underneath the design parts. <br>These parts will be hidden from the user's eye since the art layer will overlay them in the final tattoo.<br><br> -->



<!-- If you have a 2D printer at home, you can 2D print the visual design onto the tattoo transfer paper, so you can make a more complex design. Open your drawing program, and create the design. Note however, that you will need to hand-draw the conductive traces with the silver pen we provided you.<br><br>
 -->
<!-- If you don't have a 2D printer at home, you need to handdraw the design. To plan our your design, we recommend you either use a drawing program or a seperate piece of paper. You will use some color pens and the silver pen we provided you to draw your design.<br><br>
