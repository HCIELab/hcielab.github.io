 <h3 class="headline">Your Task for Today</h3>

Today, we want to move our circuits off the paper and onto other objects.<br>
In particular, we are going to use tattoo transfer paper to transfer an inkjet printed circuit onto a leather armband.<br>
The leather armband will have a menu created via touch buttons (perhaps include slider and multi-touch here?), and will have an inkjet-printed bend sensor that recognizes when the armband is put on and thus curved or removed from the arm and placed flat on the table.<br>
In addition, it will have an IMU that can count steps.<br>

 <h3 class="headline">First Experience with Tattoo Transfer: Decorative Artwork</h3><br>

We recommend before you go down into the circuit design experience, you check out how the tattoo transfer paper works using a simple aesthetic design and a test object other than the leather armband. <br><br>

<h4>Creating the Decorative Tattoo Design on the Tattoo Paper</h4><br>

Your tattoo transfer package contains two different types of sheets <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043WJ3OA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">(Silhouette Inkjet Printable tattoo paper, $7.42 for four 8.5”x11” sheets)</a>.<br>
The white sheet is the sheet on which we will create the design.<br>
The greenish sheet is the adhesive sheet, which we will use later to transfer the tattoo onto the skin.<br><br>

First, take the white sheet, i.e. the temporary tattoo paper with its paper backing our of its packaging.<br>
The white sheet has a <b>glossy side</b> and a non-glossy side.<br>
You need to create your artwork on the <b>glossy side</b>.<br><br>

Before transferring your image, make sure the image is <b>mirrored</b>, since it will be flipped when you apply the paper to your skin. <br><br>

Use the pens we provided to you to draw your design directly on the glossy side.<br> <br> 

<h4>Transferring the Tattoo onto the Skin</h4><br>

Cut out a square area around your design on the white sheet. Put the remaining white sheet back into the box for later use.<br><br>

Next, cut our a similar sized area from the green sheet, which we will be used to form the adhesive layer. Put the remaining green sheet back into the box for later use.<br><br>

When ink is dry, apply the green sheet (adhesive sheet) by peeling away the green backing and then place the sticky transparent film on to the top of the printed image.<br><br>

<img src="images/tattoo-transfer2.png" width="250px"><br><br>

Use a scraper tool or ruler to make sure the adhesive sheet is attached over the entire area, this is important so make sure you press on it properly across the entire area, otherwise parts of your tattoo will not have adhesive on them and will not stick to your skin.<br><br>

Next, cut out the design around its outline using either a scissor, laser cutter, or paper plotter (the Silhouette has a 'Temporary Tattoo Paper' setting).<br><br>

<img src="images/tattoo-transfer3.png" width="250px"><br><br>

Remove the clear plastic from the adhesive layer (yes all that's left will be the glue), which exposes the adhesive.<br><br>

<img src="images/tattoo-transfer4.png" width="250px"><br><br>

Get a wet sponge or wet cloth ready.<br>
Then apply the tattoo adhesive side to your skin and cover with the wet cloth for 10-15 seconds, you will know you are getting there when the paper backing slides off easily.<br><br>

 <h3 class="headline">Designing the Interface</h3><br>

Awesome, now that you have a sense how the Tattoo transfer process works, we can start with our real design.<br> 
From now on, please do not apply the tattoo transfer paper to your skin anymore since we don't know if you may have any skin reactions to the silver.<br> <br> 



We first need to create the aesthetic and circuit design for our on-body user interface.<br>
We will first only do the menu, and then do the bend sensor later.<br>
In particular, our menu should have 6 buttons that have the following functions: XX, YY, ZZ.<br>
We will also include one LED <a href="https://chibitronics.myshopify.com/collections/getting-started/products/red-yellow-and-blue-megapack-circuit-stickers">(see Chibitronics LED in your package)</a> to show that the Tattoo is working.<br>
Make sure you also plan where the ESP will connect, i.e. you need to have sufficiently large connector pads (1cm x 1cm) for each wire coming from a button.<br>
Note that you can cover parts of the circuit design if you put the conductive traces underneath the design parts. <br>These parts will be hidden from the user's eye since the art layer will overlay them in the final tattoo.<br><br>

<img src="images/tattoo-art-and-electronics-layer.png" width="500px"><br>

If you have a 2D printer at home, you can 2D print the visual design onto the tattoo transfer paper, so you can make a more complex design. Open your drawing program, and create the design. Note however, that you will need to hand-draw the conductive traces with the silver pen we provided you.<br><br>

If you don't have a 2D printer at home, you need to handdraw the design. To plan our your design, we recommend you either use a drawing program or a seperate piece of paper. You will use some color pens and the silver pen we provided you to draw your design.<br><br>

 <h3 class="headline">Copying your Design onto the Tattoo-Transfer Paper</h3><br>

Your tattoo transfer package contains two different types of sheets <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043WJ3OA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">(Silhouette Inkjet Printable tattoo paper, $7.42 for four 8.5”x11” sheets)</a>.<br>

The greenish sheet is the adhesive sheet, which we will use later to transfer the tattoo onto the skin.<br><br>

First, take the white sheet, i.e. the temporary tattoo paper with its paper backing our of its packaging.<br>
The white sheet has a <b>glossy side</b> and a non-glossy side.<br>
You need to create your artwork on the <b>glossy side</b>.<br><br>

Before transferring your image, make sure the image is <b>mirrored</b>, since it will be flipped when you apply the paper to your skin. <br><br>

If you use a 2D printer, make sure you know which way you have to insert the paper so that the printer prints on the glossy side. Use the printers photo paper settings if available.<br>
If you use pens, you can draw your design directly on the glossy side.<br> 
Next, use the silver pen we provided you to sketch out the conductive traces.<br>

<img src="images/tattoo-layering.png" width="450px"><br>
The paper backing and tattoo substrate are the white sheet, then you put your art layer and the conductive layer, and finally you close it off with the green adhesive sheet.<br>

 <h3 class="headline">Add Electronic Components to Tattoo Design</h3><br>

Once your artwork and conductive traces are drawn, add the electronic components onto the design.<br>
In our case, we are only going to add a simple LED from Chibitronics.<br>
This LED is already designed as a sticker and thus you can simply attach it to your circuit.<br><br>

<img src="images/chibitronics-led1.png" width="250px">
<img src="images/chibitronics-led2.png" width="180px"><br><br>


The LED is made conductive on its backside using something <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075V5J7K6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">called Electrically Conductive Adhesive Transfer Tape or short: z-tape</a>. It has this name since its structure is vertically conecting circuit traces while horizontally isolating them. See image below of somethign similar called zebra-rubber, which has the same structure. Thus, if you have other electronic components in the future, that do not have a conductive adhesive already on them, you need to attach some z-tape to them.<br><br>

<img src="images/zebrarubber.png" width="450px"><br>
If you use zebra rubber or zebra tape on your phone, you can vertically transmit your touch. See how we move the slider with our finger here.<br><br>

Electronic component height: to  minimize  the  added  thickness, only components with a thickness  of 500μm should be used. (not sure why this is necessary, I guess only if you put them right on the transfer tape, but if you mount them later onto the skin it shouldn't be an issue).<br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Transferring the Tattoo onto the Skin</h3><br>

Cut out a square area around your design on the white sheet. Put the remaining white sheet back into the box for later use.<br><br>

Next, cut our a similar sized area from the green sheet, which we will be used to form the adhesive layer. Put the remaining green sheet back into the box for later use.<br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Connect Tattoo to Microcontroller</h3><br>

To connect to the remaining circuit, you will need to do the following steps:<br><br>

First, attach the ESP with its breakout board to your arm as well.<br><br>

Next, use copper tape to connect from the breakout board connectors to the connectors of your tattoo.<br><br>

<img src="images/hardware-setup.png" width="450px"><br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Program your Tattoo</h3><br>

Open the Arduino Programming environment and load the code your wrote last week for reading a touch button.<br><br>
Make sure that if you use different pin numbers on your tattoo, you update those in your code.<br><br>

In case your touch button does not immediately work, we recommend you try to connect to the LED and make it blink.<br><br>

If that also doesn't work, you may want to use your multimeter to check if you have any disconnects on your circuit tattoo.<br><br>

If you have any disconnects, you can use the silver pen to fill in any gaps by retracing the circuit.<br><br>

<b>Blending the Art and Conductive Layer:</b> see below, (a) A dark colored pattern is printed on the art layer to completely cover the conductive layer, b) A lighter gradient color is printed on the art layer to allow the shape and silver color of the conductive layer to peek through, c) The pattern of the conductive layer is designed to complement the blue flower printed on the art layer, d) The silver conductive layer can be designed to be a design element. <br>

 <h3 class="headline">Safety</h3><br>

<b>Skin Safety of Materials</b>: We use materials for the substrate and traces that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)for safe usage on human skin. To minimize the possibility of negative skin-reaction, we use only commercially available temporary tattoo paper as the substrate, and amedical electrode grade silver screen-printing ink as the conductive material for the circuitry.<br><br>

<b>Amount of Current</b>: We are only going to use the output of the ESP32 (5V) for our devices. Since skin has a high resistance, the current is naturally limited and is considered physiologically safe for humans. At no point are you allowed to use anything else to connect to your on-skin device than the ESP32 we provided you.<br><br>

<b>Body Location</b>: You are only allowed to apply the tattoo to your fore arm. Do not apply it in other body locations, such as the chest.<br><br>

If you do not feel comfortable applying the tattoo to your skin, you can also apply it to an object in your surrounding and if that's not available, you can also apply it to a piece of paper. If you have any questions, please contact the teaching team.<br><br>

<b>we decided against fabricating the Skintillates devices with inkjet printing because of the lack of data in the safety and long-term biocompatibility of these inks. also check the silver pen.</b>
