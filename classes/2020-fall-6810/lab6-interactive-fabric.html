        <h2 class="headline">Building an Interactive Lamp: Interactive Fabric</h2>
      

In the last lab, you 3D printed the base of our interactive lamp. In this lab, you will add the interactive lamp shade by sewing touch sensors with conductive yarn into its fabric. In addition, you will mount LEDs into the base of the lamp that will light up in different colors depending on which touch sensor on the lamp shade it touched. Finally, you will build the control circuit and program the touch recognition and LED lighting.<br><br>

 <h3 class="headline">Deliverables Lab 6 (due Wednesday, Oct. 28, 2020, 11.59pm)</h3>
    
    At the end of lab 6, upload to your student google drive:
    <ul>
        <li>the ESP32 code to sense touch, and control the LEDs</li>
        <li>2-3 photos (.jpg or .png) of your 3D printed lamp that shows the circuit on the breadboard and also the final assembled lamp</li>
        <li>a video that shows how you interact with the lamp, i.e. the light turns on/off when touching the "on" button and that shows its color changing when pressing the other 3 buttons </li>
    </ul><br>

<h3 class="headline">Before Starting Lab 6</h3>

Make sure you have your 3D printed lamp base and lamp shade from lab 5 at hand.<br><br>

<h3 class="headline">(1) Laser Cut the Fabric for the Lamp Shade</h3>

First, you will create the fabric cover that will cover the 3D printed cone of the lamp shade. <br>
For this, we will first laser cut our desired shape and then sew it together.<br><br>
    
Start by creating the drawing for laser cutting.<br> 
You will need a half circle with a radius of 12.3cm.<br>
The easiest way to do this is to first draw a full circle in Illustrator.<br>
Next, delete half of the circle with the 'white mousepointer' tool, which allows you to select individual parts of the 'circle path'.<br>
Finally, to close the half circle, draw a straight line from one end to the other.<br>
Make sure you are using the correct drawing settings for laser cutting (correct line color and thickness).<br><br>

<img src="images/lab6/full-circle-size.png" width="225px">
<img src="images/lab6/full-circle.png" width="185px">
<img src="images/lab6/half-circle.png" width="160px">
<img src="images/lab6/half-circle-closed.png" width="160px"><br><br>


Next, laser cut the shape out of fabric (book a laser cutting slot in the OH schedule).<br>
We have fabric for you at the IDC.<br>
Take a pair of scissors and cut out a 30cmx20cm large patch.<br> 
Laser cut your half circle out of this patch.<br> 
When cutting, set the speed to 100% and the power to 35%.<br>
After you are done, your laser cut circle should look like in the right image below.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab6/laser_cut.png" width="425px">
    <img src="images/lab6/cut_stencil.jpg" width="240px"><br><br>
    
<h3 class="headline">(2) Sew the Fabric Lamp Shade Cover Together</h3>

Next, you need to fold your half circle fabric over in the middle as shown below.<br> 
Before you fold it, look at the fabric.<br>
You will notice that it has a good looking side with the pattern well visible and a less good looking side.<br>
After folding, the good looking side should be facing <b>inwards</b> and the not good looking side should be facing outwards.<br>
The reason we are doing this is that sewing is always done on the inside of the final object, so later on we will flip the fabric cover over and the good looking side will be visible.<br><br>

    
    <img src="images/lab6/folding_fabric_1.png" width="320px">
    <img src="images/lab6/folding_fabric_2.jpg" width="425px"><br><br>
    
Your next task is to sew together the straight edge of the half circle that is not yet connected (book an OH slot, we will do this together).<br> 
Take one of our mobile sewing machines and sew together the open straight line.<br>
To do this, insert the fabric into the sewing machine and then draw the sewing machine in one straight motion over the edge as shown below.<br>
You can start a little bit towards the inside to make the cone more tightly fit on the lamp shade.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab6/sewing_machine_1.png" width="425px"><br><br>

When you reach the end of the edge, keep the sewing machine running for another 5-10 seconds.<br>
This will add a few more knots to the yarn which will ensure that the yarn does not open up directly when you pull on it accidentally.<br>
Finally, disconnect the sewing machine and use glue to fix the yarn at the endpoint.<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab6/sewing_machine_2.png" width="300px">
    <img src="images/lab6/sewing_machine_3.png" width="300px"><br><br>
    
<h3 class="headline">(3) Embroider Touch Sensors with Conductive Yarn</h3>

Now that you have the basic fabric cover, you are ready to add the touch buttons onto the lamp shade using conductive yarn.<br>
We will add 4 touch buttons to the fabric lamp shade.<br> 
The touch buttons will later be used to turn the lamp on and off, and to set 3 different color schemes for the lamp (e.g. Red, Green, and Blue).<br><br>

<b>Insert Conductive Yarn into Needle</b><br>
For the next steps, either book a new OH slow or continue from your previous one.<br>
Take a needle and a roll of conductive yarn from our IDC storage shelve.<br>
Thread the conductive yarn into the needle.<br>
Make a double knot at the end of the yarn to make sure that it will hold onto the fabric and doesn't go through it.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab6/threadingin.png" width="425px"><br><br>
    
<b>Stitch Touch Buttons as Cross Patterns</b><br>
Stitch 4 cross patterns into the fabric, one for each touch button.<br> 
Each touch button should use its own yarn, i.e. they should not be connected together with the same thread.<br>
Every time you finish a touch button, cut off the yarn and use glue to secure the end in place.<br>
When you start the next touch button, make sure to leave at least 2cm distance to the previous touch button so there is no cross talk among the wires of the buttons.<br>
Below you see the cross stitch in detail.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab6/embroider_1.jpg" width="300px">
    <img src="images/lab6/embroider_2.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

    <img src="images/lab6/embroider_4.jpg" width="300px"><br><br> 
    <img src="images/lab6/embroider_5.jpg" width="300px"><br><br> 
    
Attach a jumper wire to the end of the conductive yarn with copper tape by wrapping the copper tape around both the jumper wire and the yarn.<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab6/jumper_1.jpg" width="300px">
    <img src="images/lab6/jumper_2.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>
    
Repeat these steps for all 4 touch areas.<br><br>

    <img src="images/lab6/jumper_3.jpg" width="300px">
    <img src="images/lab6/jumper_4.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

The fabric is now ready to be stretched over the 3D printed lamp shade. Make sure that the conductive yarns do not touch each other by glueing the jumper wires each to one of the arms of the lamp shade. <br><br>

    <img src="images/lab6/glue_jumper_1.jpg" width="300px">
    <img src="images/lab6/glue_jumper_2.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>
    <img src="images/lab6/glue_jumper_3.jpg" width="300px">
    <img src="images/lab6/glue_jumper_4.jpg" width="300px"><br><br> 
    
<h3 class="headline">(4) Preparing the LEDs</h3>
    
We will use Neopixel LEDs to add light to the lamp. These are RGB LEDs that can be addressed individually. The LEDs come on a large roll from which you have to cut of a stripe of 4 LEDs from it. You will find 3 copper pads between each LED. Cut these pads right in the middle such that you have enough copper left to solder wires on them. <br><br>

The LEDs have 3 copper connects that we want to access with jumper wires. The orientation is important here. You will find arrows between each LED that point in a certain direction. In the image below, they point to the left. We will connect the jumper wires on the side which the arrows point away from (the right hand side on the image below).<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab6/LED_stripe_1.jpg" width="500px"><br><br>
    
The stripe is covered with a silicone film that protects it from water and other environmental influences. Remove the silicone from the copper pads and solder jumper wires on each pad. Use the same technique as in lab 4. First put a solder drop on each pad and then, press the tip of the jumper wire on the drop with the solder iron.<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab6/LED_stripe_2.jpg" width="500px"><br><br>
    
Finally, remove the blue foil from back of the LED stripes which reveals double sided tape on the back. Now, glue the LEDs to one of the free arms inside the printed lamp shade.<br><br>
    
    <img src="images/lab6/glue_LED_1.jpg" width="425px">
    <img src="images/lab6/glue_LED_2.jpg" width="240px"><br><br>
    
The lamp shade is ready and finished now. Let's move on to building the circuit for the touch areas and controlling the LEDs.
