        <h2 class="headline">Conductive 3D Printing</h2>
      
          <hr>

 <h3 class="headline">Your Task for Today</h3>

So far, we have slowly been inching towards 3D circuits: the interactive card was 2D, tattoo transfer paper allows us to put circuits on curved surfaces, now 3D printing actually allows us to make true 3D circuits that route even through the inside of objects.<br><br>

Today, you will first 3D print the 3D model of a game controller in two materials: regular plastic filament and conductive filament, which can be used to 3D print wires and touch buttons for capacitive sensing. We will give you a 3D model of the game controller, but you need to slice it yourself to prepare it for 3D printing and you will wire it up to a tetris game in Processing to show that it works.<br>
In the second half of the tutorial, we will show you how to go beyond using existing 3D models and how to make your own design. For this, we will give you a short introduction into 3D modeling with the 3D editor blender and we will create a simple touch slider yourself. We will first 3D model manually and then also briefly look into how we can create shapes via code.<br><br>

<h3 class="headline">3D Printing with two Filaments</h3><br>

To print with two filaments, you need a dual-material 3D printer with two print heads.<br>
In our case, we use the Ultimaker 3.<br><br>

If you look closely in the images below, you can see there are two tubes (first image) feeding two different filaments into two print heads (second image), which results in a dual-material print (third image).<br><br>

<img src="images/ultimaker.jpg" width="353px">
<img src="images/ultimaker-two-printheads.jpg" width="353px">
<img src="images/ultimaker-two-materials.png" width="353px"><br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Conductive and Non-Conductive Filaments</h3><br>

We used Maker Geeks Conductive ABS for the conductive part and XX for the non-conductive part.<br><br>

The filament has a high resistance, a typical circuit has a base-line resistance in the MÎ© range. Thus, note, that current conductive filaments are only conductive enough for capacitive touch sensing and lighting an LED, but it has too high of a resistance for anything else since it consists of mostly plastic mixed with carbon.<br><br>

<img src="images/conductive-pla.png" width="253px"><br><br>


<h3 class="headline">Modeling for Conductive Inkjet Printing</h3><br>

For starters, let look at the example of this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:744669">game controller from Thingiverse</a>.<br>

<img src="images/conductive-pla-game-controller.jpg" width="353px"><br>

As you can see in the image below, you need to create two different meshes, one for each material.<br>
In the 3D printing software later, we can load each mesh and assign it a different material, so that during printing the 3D printer knows which material/nozzle to use.<br><br>

<img src="images/game-controller1-front.png" width="353px">
<img src="images/game-controller2-front.png" width="346px"><br><br>

If you are confused how these models correlated to the image above, you need to flip them in your head since the game-controller will be printed up-side-down to avoid support material.<br><br>

<img src="images/game-controller1.png" width="353px">
<img src="images/game-controller2.png" width="346px"><br><br>

If you go to download, you can see that the two models come in .stl file format.<br>
.stl file format is the format that the slicer takes as input.<br>
So if you later 3D model something in a 3D editor, you have to make sure you export as .stl file.<br>
Let's go ahead an download the two .stl files.<br><br>

<img src="images/game-controller-stl-files.png" width="453px"><br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Slicing for Dual Material Printing</h3><br>

To convert a 3D model for 3D printing, you have to load it into a software called a Slicer.<br>
A slicer takes your 3D model and slices it horizontally into a number of layers.<br>
Each layer is then converted into a print path (a long line filling the layer) that the print head follows while laying down material.<br><br>

The slicer we are going to use is called Cura for Ultimaker and you installed it prior to this lab.<br>
Note that most branded 3D printers have their own slicer (e.g. the MakerBot 3D printer uses the MakerBot slicer).<br>
However, there are also slicers that can be used for many different 3D printers, e.g. a slicer called Slic3r supports this.<br><br>

Open Cura and load both of the 3D models from Thingiverse into the view.<br>
If they are misaligned, make sure to align them on top of each other by setting each of the 3D models x,y,z coordinates to 0,0,0.<br><br>

<img src="images/cura-aligning-meshes1.png" width="553px"><br>
<img src="images/cura-aligning-meshes2.png" width="553px"><br>

Next, let's make sure we are going to use the correct 3D printer settings for slicing, i.e. there are different Ultimakers, e.g. Ultimaker 1,2,3, S5 etc and they all need different settings.<br>
Click on the top left corner on the 3D printer name, then 'manage printers', in the opening window click on 'add' to add a new printer, and then open the 'add a non-networked printer' dialog.<br>
In the dialog window, select the Ultimaker 3 Extended, which is the printer we are using for the class. Confirm the selection by clicking 'Add' and make sure that once the window closed, under 'local printers' the Ultimaker 3 Extended is now selected. Click 'close'. <br><br>

<img src="images/cura-selecting-printer1.png" width="453px"><br>
<img src="images/cura-selecting-printer2.png" width="453px"><br>
<img src="images/cura-selecting-printer3.png" width="453px"><br>
<img src="images/cura-selecting-printer4.png" width="453px"><br><br>

Now that you have the 3D printer configured, we are ready to setup the materials for 3D printing, i.e. tell the slicer which extruder head will hold which material.<br>
In our setup, we are using extruder 1 with regular white PLA filament, and extruder 2 with conductive PLA filament.<br><br>

To do this, click on the top where it says (1) Generic PLA and select the white PLA from the list (see below).<br><br>
Repeat the process with (2) and assign the conductive PLA (Michael: it is not in the list of materials, we may have to install the settings file for this first).<br>

<img src="images/cura-extruder1-whitepla.png" width="553px"><br><br>
<img src="images/cura-extruder2-conductivepla.png" width="553px"><br><br>

Now that you have assigned each extruder a material, you are ready to go to the next step: assign your model geometry to an extruder and thereby to a material. Click on one of the two meshes and in the left toolbar, choose either 1 or 2 depending on which material you want to print it with. The visualization should update accordingly, i.e. in the view you now see that the inner part is colored black since it will be printed from the black conductive material.<br><br>

<img src="images/cura-assign-material-to-mesh.png" width="553px"><br><br>

We are all set for slicing now!<br>
Click the slice button on the right side.<br>
Once slicing has finished, it should tell you how long the model will print and how much material it will require.<br>
Note that if you go to print settings and you change the quality from e.g. 'fast' to 'fine' the print time will more than double.<br>
However, at the same time, you will also get a higher quality print since 'fine' uses a thinner layer height than 'fast'.<br><br>

<img src="images/cura-fast.png" width="353px">
<img src="images/cura-fine.png" width="353px"><br><br>


Once you sliced, you can either save the file or preview it.<br>
Let's look at preview for a moment.<br>
The vertical slider allows you to step through each layer of your print and check if everything looks correct.<br><br>

<img src="images/cura-layer-preview1.png" width="353px">
<img src="images/cura-layer-preview2.png" width="353px"><br><br>

The horizontal 'play' bar then plays an animation of how the print head will print that particular layer, pretty neat!<br><br>

<img src="images/cura-layer-preview3.png" width="353px"><br><br>

Once you are sure everything looks good, you can save the file.<br>
Note that the file extension is .gcode, which is what the 3D printer takes as input.<br><br>

<br>
<div style="background:#04a47c;padding:10px;">Checkoff 1: Show the teaching team your Cura setup and send them the .gcode file your exported, so we can check if it would print correctly.</div><br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Wiring up the Game Controller</h3><br>

You probably have seen that you have the game controller in your package already 3D printed.<br>
To wire up the game controller, you can simple attach some crocodile clamps as shown in the image below.<br><br>

<img src="images/conductive-pla-game-controller.jpg" width="253px">
<img src="images/game-controller-tetris.jpg" width="453px"><br><br>



Let's connect this to your microcontroller and to processing and show that the game controller actually takes input.<br>
Michael: can we have a small tetris game or similar to which we can connect the game controller?<br><br>

<div style="background:#04a47c;padding:10px;">Checkoff 2: Show that your game controller can be used to play the tetris game we gave you.</div><br><br>

<h3 class="headline">Modeling for Dual Material 3D Printing in the 3D Editor Blender</h3><br>

Allright, so you have seen how you can use an existing 3D model and 3D print it using dual material 3D printing.<br>
But what if you want to create your own 3D model design?<br>
To help you get started with this, we are going to make a simple dual-material 3D model in the 3D editor Blender.<br><br>

(more info to come here with a simple example)<br><br>


<h3 class="headline">Scripting for Dual Material 3D Printing in Blender</h3><br>

In Blender, you can also program 3D shapes with Python.<br>
All you have to do is go to the scripting window.<br>
Making a Cube is faily simple as you can see below.<br><br>

You can either type it into the command line directly like here:<br><br>

<img src="images/blender-scripting1.png" width="553px"><br><br>

Or you can save it as a new python file like so:<br><br>

<img src="images/blender-scripting2.png" width="553px"><br><br>

As you can see, you can call all actions you can also do manually, such as a boolean diff to seperate out the wire from the other shape.<br><br>

<img src="images/blender-scripting3.png" width="553px"><br><br>

(this needs to be replaced with a good example and explanation)<br><br>
