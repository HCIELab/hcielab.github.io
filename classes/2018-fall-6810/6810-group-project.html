         <h2 class="headline">Open Ended Project (1-2 people)</h2>

        </br>
        </br>

        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">Task:</div>
        In this group project, you will build an interactive device of your choice.</br>
        The device needs to solve a real-world problem.</br>
        
        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">Hardware / Software Requirements</div>
        <ul>
          <li>#1 code of sufficient complexity you have written</li>
          <li>#2 electronics you wired up yourself (your choice of board and sensors)</li>
          <li>#3 fabricated parts you laser cut or 3D printed (or milled, or thermoformed...)</li>
          <li>#4 integrates some advanced interactive technology you have seen in the lecture (e.g., Augmented Reality, Brain Computer Interfaces, Multi-Touch, Haptics)</li>
        </ul>
        Your time does not need to be split equally between all four components, you can focus on some components more than on others, but we need to see that you have covered all four.</br>

        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">Budget:</div>
        <ul>
          <li>every student gets $50 project budget, if you work in a team of 2 you have $100 in total</li>
          <li>if you need a part, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xN52LXDr-Mb0rjz5Jbs4p0BV3Cw7rTFlPxhqd7gNlAs/edit?usp=sharing">add the details to this spreadsheet</a></li>
          <li>we order on mondays, wednesdays, and fridays at noon</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">Size of Project:</div>
        The project should be about 9 regular weeks worth of work (minus class time) for each person, so about 18 person-weeks worth of work for the team. It should be much more extensive than a regular class exercise, but don't propose something unrealistic. </br>

        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">Final Deliverables</div>
        <ul>
          <li>a project website including:</li>
          <li>high-resolution photos of your prototype</li>
          <li>a 2D drawing of your project concept</li>
          <li>a kickstarter-style video show-casing your prototype</li>
          <li>link to your midterm presentation</li>
          <li>link to your final presentation</li>
          <li>link to your git repository with your code</li>
          <li>(optional) dropbox folder link with other files</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">Grading:</div>
        <ul>
          <li>5% idea generation</li>
          <li>25% for milestone (5% for each of the 5 Milestones).</br>
          <li>20% midterm presentation and demo </br>
          <li>30% final presentation with video, photo, illustration, and live demo </br>

        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">#1 Teams due (Sept. 12, 2018)</div>
        You will work in teams of 1-2 students.</br>
        Once you know your team partner, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LlIASPXLqln4oJSiJ56RLPVo2gSNOmojsKXG3CcicPY/edit?usp=sharing">add their name to this google doc.</a></br>
        If you want to work alone, add your own name but we recommend teaming up: You can learn from each other, can motivate and support each other, and you will have more money for doing your project (we give every student $50).</br>
        Leave team website blank for now.</br></br>

        If you have trouble finding a team member, we recommend you post project ideas on Piazza and see who is interested in joining you. You can also email the staff to be placed into a team. If you do that, send an email to stefanie.mueller@mit.edu and we see what we can do. </br>

        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">#2 Setup Project Website (Sept. 19, 2018)</div>
        Copy the website template from here [PLACEHOLDER].</br>
        You can use any webspace you like. We recommend using the MIT webspace.</br> 
        Please change the text with the team member names, but the rest can stay as it is for now. </br>

        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">#3 Upload best 5 ideas (Sept. 28, 2018)</div>
        With you team member, brainstorm different project ideas.<br>
        The more ideas you generate, the more you have to pick from in the end.<br> 
        After your brainstorming, pick the <b>best five ideas</b> you have and upload them to your project website as a scribble and some text (max. 100 words per idea) explaining the idea.<br><br>

        Please <b>do not</b> make super polished drawings at this point as this is counter productive to the whole brainstorming idea. Your ideas should be presented low-fidelity in look (aka sketches) so your audience feels invited to provide feedback. You still need to make sure your audience is able to understand what you are showing. 
        <br>

        Here's a brainstorming we ran in my lab a few weeks ago:<br><br>
        <img src="../../images/classes/eit/five-best-ideas/brainstorming notes.jpg" width="400" style="border:black 1px solid">

        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">#4 Presentation: Introduce Yourself + Present Ideas (Oct. 4, 2018)</div>
        6 min presentation per team (3 min about yourself, 3 min about your best 5 ideas)<br>
        Create your slides as a google presentation and add the link to your project website.</br>
             
        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">#5 Feedback from Teaching Team (Oct. 3, 2018)</div>
        Which of your five ideas you choose for your project is up to you.</br>
        However, the teaching team will send you an email that will describe which ideas we find most promising / innovative, i.e. we will rank your five ideas based on what we think will make a great class project.</br>
        No need to do anything right now, just read the email and think about it. </br>

        <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">#6 Decide on Idea + Upload Workplan (Oct. 3, 2018)</div>
        Pick one of your five ideas as your final project. </br>
        Double check that your project meets the project guidelines listed here [TODO]. </br>
        If you have questions about whether a project idea fits into the guidelines, please post on Piazza so we can answer for everyone to see.</br></br>

        The proposal should be a 3-5 page PDF document.</br>        
        Create your proposal as a google docs file [TODO] and add the link to your proposal to the project website. </br>
        The proposal should have the following sections:
        <ul>
          <li>One-paragraph overview of the entire project</li>
          <li>More detailed description of the intended functionality, including a system block diagram and tentative state machine diagrams (high level stuff)</li>
          <li>Technical challenges that you foresee</li>
          <li>Parts list, if applicable. The parts list should have description, item number, vendor, and price.</li>
          <li>You will also make a milestone and demo table, as described in the next section.</li>
        </ul>

        Make sure your proposal meets all the guidelines posted above. If we need to iterate with your team on your proposal because of missing content from above, it will cost you in time and grade.</br></br>

        <b>More on milestones:</b>
        Each week on friday, you will upload one or more short video snippets to your project website that demonstrate your progress on the project.</br> 
        In particular, we will ask you to define a set of weekly milestones for the entire project period that when implemented together, will result in the final demo on demo day at the end of this class.</br> 
        As part of your proposal, you will create that <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BLJgReV5EnI-kmVRD-1R3QMJcoTdDHyBts218udpim8/edit?usp=sharing">Milestones spreadsheet (click here for template).</a> Make a copy and fill it out.</br></br>
        Each milestone will be graded based on the video you upload. </br> 
        If you have 1 milestone for a week, it's either 100% or nothing in case it doesn't work. </br> 
        If you have 4 milestones for a week, each will be worth 25% (4x25% = 100%), so if three work and one doesn't you get 75% for the week. </br>
        Each week is worth XX%.</br>
        You can revise your milestones until Monday evening of that week, i.e. for a milestone due on Friday, Oct. XX, you can still change your milestone for the week until Monday evening, Oct. XX, 11.59pm.</br>
 




        Well-written milestones and demos are easy to interpret. For example, here is a poorly written milestone and demo:
        <i>April 21: Work on code to read sensor input</i>. 
        This is not a useful milestone because it is really a task (what you'll be doing) rather than a milestone (what you'll accomplish). One could "work" on code for various amounts of time and make various amounts of progress. In addition, no demo is proposed. Looking at your code with the staff by itself is not a good demo! Here is a better-written milestone and demo: <i>Milestone: April 21: Finish ESP32-side code for reading values from humidity sensor and sending to Seral port. Demo: Show streaming sensor values on Serial monitor as humidity is changed by breathing on sensor.</i> </br>
        Your project should have more then one milestone and demo each week. This is because you'll want to break down your system development into parts that each teammate can work on, and you want each teammate to have responsibilities each week. 
        </br> 
        </br> 
        Each milestone will be graded based on the video you upload. </br> 
        </br>
        <b>End-to-end system first!</b></br>
        In developing your proposal and milestome/demo schedule, think about what is the minimum viable product, aka what is the minimum system that gets at the essentials of what you want to do. Sure, your final system will have some bells and whistles, and you want to reach to do something hard, but make sure you have something working early in the process.</br>
        What you don't want to do is to set up your schedule so the first end-to-end test of the system is the weekend before the project report deadline. Because your first end-to-end test won't work. So you want to iron out those issues early, create an alpha version or beta version, and then have time to improve it. </br>
        </br>
        <b>Revising Milestones</b></br>
        Your initial set of milestones will be a best guess as to how the project will proceed. You'll find that your best guess is not very good. Some things will be easier than anticipated. Some will be harder, and will either take longer than anticipated or will need to be re-evaluated (for example, midway through your project you may decide that using a joystick is not the best approach and you'd rather use buttons).
        </br>
        We want to allow you to revise milestones and demos. After each Tuesday or Thursday meeting, you will have until Wednesday or Friday evening (one day), respectively to propose any revisions to your milestone and demo table. Alert your mentors as to any proposed changes via email. They will approve, disapprove, or revise by end of Friday if you are a Tuesday demo-day-group or Sunday if you are a Thursday demo-day-group. Then the milestones stay fixed until the next Tue/Thu mentor meeting. Editing milestones after Friday (for Tuesday groups) or Sunday (for Thursday groups) will result in a zero for that week's milestone/demo grade.

        Each milestone will be graded based on the video you upload. </br> 
        If you have 1 milestone for a week, it's either 100% or nothing in case it doesn't work. </br> 
        If you have 4 milestones for a week, each will be worth 25% (4x25% = 100%), so if three work and one doesn't you get 75% for the week. </br>
        Each week is worth XX%.</br>

  <b> <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:25px">Project Requirements:</div></b>
While we leave most of the project up to you, we have the following requirements:
 <ul>
          <li>must involve custom laser cut, 3D printed, or milled parts</li>
          <li>must involve custom electronics</li>
          <li>must involve custom code and include some data being sent via wifi</li>
          <li>must be interactive, i.e. react to user input</li>
          <li>must be innovative and solve a real-world need (test pitch to your fellow students, do they buy into it?)</li>
 </ul>

Here are some example projects (borrowed from Bjoern Hartmann's class at UC Berkeley):<br>
<br>
 <div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px"><b>Project Example #1: Smart Cup</b></div></a>
<img src="../images/classes/open-ended-project/smart-cup.png" width="600px"><br><br>

Smart Cup uses light sensors to identify what the user is currently drinking. Light sensors work because each drink has a different color (coffee is brown while lemonade is yellow). Smart Cup uses this information to give the user a summary of daily intake on the user's mobile phone and helps with healthier drink choices, e.g. by recommending to drink more water and less coffee. The project includes: 3D printed housing, sensors inside and display facing outside, connection to mobile phone via wifi and custom app.<br><br>


<div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px"><b>Project Example #2: Flow Shower Add-on</b></div></a>
<img src="../images/classes/open-ended-project/flow.png" width="600px"><br><br>

Flow is an add-on for the shower that measures data, such as the current water temperature and the flow rate of the water. Based on this information, Flow can inform the user about the water usage during a specific day and can also alert the user when a certain temperature is reached and the water might become too hot. The project includes: custom laser cut and 3D printed housing that is watertight, custom sensors, connection to mobile phone via wifi and custom app.<br><br>

<div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px"><b>Project Example #3: Firefighter Safety</b></div></a>
<img src="../images/classes/open-ended-project/firefighter.png" width="600px"><br><br>

The Helios device collects data when a firefighter is on site. It transmits this data to a control center to allow the operations manager to make informed decisions of how to help the firefighters e.g. when they run out of tank pressure or when the gas level in the environment is too high. 3D printed enclosure, multiple sensors, and connection to web interface via wifi.<br><br>


<div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px"><b>Project Example #4: Plant Watering</b></div></a>
<img src="../images/classes/open-ended-project/water-measurement2.jpg" width="600px"><br><br>

The H2O IQ device is a drip irrigation system that reports its moisture to a web interface and queries data about optimal moisture for the plant. It also uses a servo motor to activate a valve to provide more or less water. 3D printed enclosure, custom sensors, connection to web interface via wifi.<br><br>

<div style="font-size:12pt;margin-bottom:8px"><b>Project Example #5: Bar Tender Mixer</b></div></a>
<img src="../images/classes/open-ended-project/barrel-gauge.png" width="600px"><br><br>

Measures if the bartender is shaking the drink correctly and gives visual feedback to the bartender to improve next time. 3D printed enclosure, multiple sensors, and connection to web interface via wifi.
