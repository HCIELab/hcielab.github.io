<h4 style="color:red"><a href="https://learning-modules.mit.edu/gradebook/index.html?uuid=/course/6/fa18/6.810#assignments/40570776" style="color:red">Upload 1 (due end of class, Nov. 16, 2.30pm): <br>
	upload your video storyboard + a first version of your 1 minute video of your touchpad.</a> </h4>
<br><br>

<h4 style="color:red"><a href="https://learning-modules.mit.edu/gradebook/index.html?uuid=/course/6/fa18/6.810#assignments/40570946" style="color:red">Optional: Upload 2 (due end of class, Nov. 21, 1pm): <br>
	final 1 minute video of your touchpad</a> </h4>
	<span style="color:red">Since you have many things to do for the final presentations, we leave the upload 2 final touchpad video optional, i.e. as long as you uploaded some sequence of edited video with Upload 1 you will be fine. We still recommend you finish the video if you have time since it makes a great addition to your project portfolio (and we'd love to have some examples for next year :)).</span>

 <br> 
<h3>Goal for Today:</h3>
We are going to shoot + edit a 1 minute video of your touchpad today.<br>
We will show you how to cut the video and create text overlays etc.<br><br>

<video width="560" height="315" controls>
  <source src="images/video-editing/touch-v2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
 <br>  <br> 

Watch the video a few times, any effects you notice?  <br> 
One for instance is that the video material is cut to the beat of the music, which gives is a really nice flow.
 <br>  <br> 

<h4 style="color:red">This is work in progress, I will remove this line when I'm done.</h4>

<h3>Step 1: Draw a Short Storyboard (5 min)</h3>

Take a piece of paper and sketch out the scenes you are planning to shoot.<br>
<br>

<ul>
	<li>What do you want to show in which scene?</li>
	<li>What would you label in the image? </li>
	<li>Which text will be on a black bar at the bottom?</li>
</ul>
<br>

We suggest making three sections:

<ul>
	<li>hardware functionality (similar to your pset2 video, potentially label LEDs, switch etc.)</li>
	<li>OpenCV thresholding (similar to your pset3 video)</li>
	<li>Application (similar to your pset4 video)</li>
</ul>

<br>

Here is an early storyboard example that we started drawing before we created our touchpad video:
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/drawn-storyboard.jpg" width="543px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>
Storyboards do not necessarily have to be hand-drawn (see below). <br>
You could also make rotoscopes, or use images directly (either from the internet or 
in your specific case where you already have the implemented touchpad ready, you could also snap photos from the prototype + take some screenshots from your application on screen and use those in the storyboard).<br> 
<br>

<img src="images/video-editing/picture-storyboard.jpg" width="543px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

<h3>Step 2: Animatics</h3>

An animatic is an animated storyboard to get a better feeling for the timing and length of the scenes in a video. Most often, it literally consists of all the images from the storyboard assembled into a video with each image being played for a different length. Sometimes voices and sound effects are already added since they contribute a lot to the mood of a video.<br><br>

Due to time reasons we will not do this today, but we thought we let you know that this tends to be used not only in hollywood movies but is also very standard for any type of product marketing video since it's much cheaper to produce than the actual video.
<br><br>

Play both videos at the same time (use some headphones!):<br><br>
<iframe width="373" height="210" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wzi6xl4aEJA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <iframe width="373" height="210" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TlbnGSMJQbQ?start=20" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br><br>

And sometimes these animatics are even made using cheap 3D animation (yes it was probably cheaper to do it this way than 'rent' this guy for a day).
Compare these<br><br>

<br><br>

... or a mash up of 3D animation, pictures and other footage.

<br>

<h3>Step 3: Shoot Video (15 min)</h3>

Let's go for it and shoot the video scenes from your video storyboard.<br>
Read the tips below before you get started.<br>
<br>

<h4>Clean Background</h4><br>
Same as with the photos, use a clean backdrop and make sure there is no crap in the image that shouldn't be there.

<br><br>
<h4>Never Zoom</h4><br>
Yes, you can zoom to find a good image frame *before* you start recording, but *after* you hit the record button you should never ever zoom. Video material that uses zooming will immediately make you look unprofessional. <br><br>

The reason for this is that the very act of zooming has no equivalent in the human eye (our eyes cannot zoom in and out) and thus the material will always look unnatural.
<br><br>

<h4>Always use a tripod</h4><br>

Please always use a tripod, otherwise your video will be shaky.<br>
Make sure the water balance is leveled. 
<br><br>

<h4>Shoot every scene multiple times</h4><br>

I always shoot every scene 3 times just in case something went wrong and I didn't notice. I also ideally slightly vary the action (e.g. come into the frame with the finger a little steeper or flatter). 

<br><br>
<h4>Keep the placement of sub-titles and labels in mind!</h4><br>

Keep in mind you may put subtitles in the lower half of the video later on.<br>
If you planned to put labels somewhere, did you leave enough space in the frame? <br> Planning is key here to avoid major frustration later on.

<br><br>

<h3>Edit Video using Adobe Premiere Pro</h3>

If you do not have <a href="https://www.adobe.com/downloads.html">Adobe Premiere (there is a 7 day test version),</a> scroll down for instructions on how to use Shotcut, a free open-source program.<br><br>

<a href="images/video-editing/example-premiere-project.zip" style="color:red">To get started, download this template project here</a>.

<br><br>

After opening the Premiere Project file, you should see something like this:
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/premiere-interface.png" width="783px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

<h4>Adding your Video Material</h4><br>

In the first step, drag some of your video material (or a photo) onto the video timeline here.
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/video-timeline.png" width="783px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

The video timeline has multiple 'tracks' (layers).<br>
If you don't see your video material in the top window after you dragged it on the timeline, there is probably something else on top that covers it up.<br>
<br>

<h4>Adding Text, Outlines, etc.</h4><br>

You can drag almost any file type onto the timeline (e.g. .jpg files, .ai files from Illustrator).<br>
I typically create my text in Illustrator, then drag the Illustrator file onto the timeline (if you do not have Illustrator, you can also use a different drawing program like inkscape or gimp).
<br><br>

This black-text-overlay.ai Illustrator file on the timeline (also in the example project folder) corresponds to the '6.810 Engineering Interactive Technologies - Multi-Touch Pad' text.
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-text1.png" width="353px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-text2.png" width="333px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

To edit it, I right-click onto the black-text-overlay.ai on the timeline and then click 'Edit Original', which opens the file in Illustrator. <br>

In Illustrator I change the file, save it, and when I go back to Premiere it will update automatically (see below).<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-text3.png" width="383px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-text4.png" width="293px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

In the same way, you can add any type of drawing onto your video.<br>
Here I drew a dotted white outline in Illustrator that highlights the touchpad and then overlaid it with the video file (see below).<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-outlines1.png" width="693px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<img src="images/video-editing/adding-outlines2.png" width="693px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

<h4>Moving and Scaling Elements</h4><br>

If you are not happy with the placement of the text, you can also move it around in Premiere or scale it by going to 'Effects Controls' and then change the slider values under position and scale. 

<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/move-and-scale1.png" width="793px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>
Changing the position of the black title bar:
<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/move-and-scale2.png" width="793px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

And making it bigger:

<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/move-and-scale3.png" width="793px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<br><br>

You can do the same thing with any element in the video timeline, such as the photo of the touchpad.<br>
Here I first double clicked the opening photo, then used scale to make the photo smaller and position to move it above the text.<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/move-and-scale4.png" width="793px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>

<h4>Dip to Black, Cross-Dissolve and other Transitions</h4><br>

Transitions are really useful when you have a logical break, e.g. you show the OpenCV tracking and have multiple scenes about it, and then afterwards you show the application with multiple scenes. In-between these two steps it would be good to add a dip to black or other transition to show to the viewer that a new chapter starts.
<br><br>

To do this, click on 'Effects', then 'Video Transitions' and then drag e.g. the Dip to Black' between two video-snippets on the timeline.
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/transitions1.png" width="793px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 

<br><br>
Which should give you something like this:
<br><br>

<img src="images/video-editing/transitions2.png" width="213px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/video-editing/transitions3.png" width="223px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> 
<img src="images/video-editing/transitions4.png" width="226px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> <br><br>

<h3>Edit Video using Shotcut</h3>
If you do not yet have Shotcut, you can download it <a href="https://shotcut.org/download/" style="color:red">here</a>.

<br><br>
<a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/hcie/files/classes/engineering-interactive-technologies/class-files/shotcut-example.zip" style="color:red">To get started, download this template project here</a> (you can ignore the 'file not found' warnings when you open the project, apparently shotcut has no way to unlink file references that are not used anymore).

<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/shotcut-main-disp-commented.png" width="750px" style="border:1px solid grey" />
<br><br>
<h4>Adding your Video Material</h4><br>
To get started with Shotcut you should know two things. When you first open the software, you will notice that the window is split into a few regions. On the left there is column interface. Choose the playlist tab to view, add, or remove media files from the project.

<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/shotcut-sidebar-commented.png" width="500px" style="border:1px solid grey" />
<br><br>

The bottom region is used to organize and stitch media together in tracks. Here you can start a track like so.

<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/shotcut-add-tracks.png" width="500px" style="border:1px solid grey" />
<br><br>

Once you have a track just drag and drop files from your playlist into the track you want.

<br><br>
<img src="images/video-editing/shotcut-track-commented.png" width="500px" style="border:1px solid grey" />
<br><br>

<h4>Adding Text, Outlines, etc.</h4><br>
Shotcut allows you to add various effects to your media. This includes text, fading in and out, etc. Here is a basic video about various filters.

<br><br>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Um8GlZeF9gg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br><br>
<h4>Other helpful information</h4><br>
<ul>
    <li>If you drag one clip into another clip on the same track, they will automatically fade together. </li>
    <li>You can use the 's' key to automatically split a clip.</li>
    <li>All clips you add to a track can also be shortened by dragging handles at the beginning or end of the track</li>
    <li>You can have multiple video tracks to create interesting effects like videos within videos, or videos in static images.</li>
    <li>You can adjust the speed of a clip by selecting the clip and selecting the "Properties" button at the top menu bar. There should be a settable "speed parameter.</li>
    <li>You can export videos by navigating "File->Export Video..." There are several options. I selected "H.264 High Profile" and pressed the "Export File" button.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 5: Add Music</h3>

Videos are often more fun with music.<br>
Websites, <a href="https://www.jamendo.com/">such as Jamendo.com,</a> provide many free sound files as long as you distribute your own work under creative commons license as well. <br>
Otherwise you might have to pay, depending on the platform you use.<br><br>

 <a href="https://www.jamendo.com/"><img src="images/video-editing/jamendo.png" width="456px" style="border:1px solid grey" /> </a>
<br><br>


<h3>Same as for photos:<br> Do not have people question if you cut something out!</h3><br>

I (and many others) who review hundreds of materials (videos, papers) every year can see in a second if something did not work. Please don't get yourself into the situation where an investor (or in this case your instructor) is questioning if your prototype really worked.

<br><br>

Here's an example from some good friends of mine whose work I truly admire.
However, in their video, when they remove the support material, you can clearly see they didn't want to show just how exhausting and time consuming it is to take the support material off. There are many cuts while the support material is removed (with some blending in-between) and half-way through the scene is completely cut off and *tata* the object is ready and on the table.

<h3><a id="examplevideos" class="anchor">Example Videos</a></h3><br>

Here are some videos from 6.810 students (former 6.S063) from last year (they had a different project). I leave it up to you if you want to do it Kickstarter Style, i.e. talk to the camera, or do a voice over, or do no voice over and instead overlay text + use some music (see below research videos).
