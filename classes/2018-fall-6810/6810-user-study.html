<h4 style="color:red">This is work in progress, I remove this line when I'm done.</h4>

<br><br>

<h3>Goal for Today:</h3><br>
The goal for today is to get started on designing + preparing your user study. The teaching team is around if you have any questions.
<br><br>

<h3>Step 1: Take the Human-Subjects Training <br>
	(do it some time after class, it takes ca. 1 hour)</h3><br>

Before running a user study involving human subjects at MIT, <br>everyone has to take the training course: <a href="https://couhes.mit.edu/training-research-involving-human-subjects"><b>Research Involving Human Subjects</b></a>. <br><br>

Once you have done the course, export the certificate you receive at the end and <a href="https://learning-modules.mit.edu/gradebook/index.html?uuid=/course/6/fa18/6.810#assignments/40454552" style="color:red">upload it to gradebook as a .pdf.</a>

<h3>Step 2: Getting your Study Approved</h3><br>

Before you can run your study, you have to get it approved by an IRB (Institutional Review Board). The IRB is an administrative body established to protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects recruited to participate in research activities. At MIT, this is done through <a href="http://couhes.mit.edu/">COUHES (Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects)</a>.
<br><br>

Creating an IRB application is a ton of work since they want to know many details about the study. After you submit the study description, the IRB approval can take several weeks or even months. Since we are doing a small study in class and not for research, we will skip this step, but I recommend you look at the documents below for the adaptive learning basketball study to get an idea.
<br><br>

<b>IRB Documents for Adaptive Learning Basketball Study:</b>
<ul>
<li><a href="images/user-study/0-application-form.pdf"/>IRB Application Form</a> </li>
<li><a href="images/user-study/1-user-study-design.pdf"/>User Study Design</a> </li>
<li><a href="images/user-study/2-consent-form.pdf"/>Consent Form</a> </li>
<li><a href="images/user-study/3-video-release-form"/>Video Release Form</a> </li>
<li><a href="images/user-study/4-pre-test-questionnaire.pdf"/>Pre-test Questionnaire</a> </li>
<li><a href="images/user-study/5-post-test-questionnaire.pdf"/>Post-Test Questionnaire</a> </li>
<li><a href="images/user-study/6-recruitment-flyer.pdf"/>Recruitment Flyer</a> </li>
</ul>
<br>

If everything is according to the IRB protocols, you will receive an
<a href="images/user-study/7-approval.pdf"/>IRB Approval Notice</a> and you are ready to start the study. Again we will not do this for 6.810 since you are doing a very small study in the context of a class and not for a research project but the documents above might come in handy when you plan your study.

<br><br>

<h3>Step 3: Find Users</h3>

Find at least three representative users from your target population. <br> 
None of your users should be enrolled in 6.810. <br> 
All should be willing to participate voluntarily.<br><br>  

<h3>Step 4: Prepare + Run Study</h3>

When your participants do the study, you need to make sure everyone <br> 
<ul>
	<li>is getting the same amount of information</li>
	<li>does the task in exactly the same way</li>
</ul>

<br> 
We will now explain the different parts most studies follow.<br> 
In particular, we will walk you through the <a href="images/user-study/1-user-study-design.pdf"/ style="color:red">User Study Design.pdf</a> we had already linked above as part of the IRB approval. Again we will not do everything described in the document, but we will do some part of it.
<br> <br> 

<h4>Phase 1: Briefing + Consent Form</h4>
<br>

<ul>
	<li>Welcome the participants.</li>
	<li>Explain very broadly what the study is about ('in this study we test a new basketball prototype').</li>
	<li>Have participants agree that they want to participate by signing the consent form (example file here <a href="images/user-study/2-consent-form.pdf" style="color:red"/>ConsentForm.pdf</a>. Re-assure them they can withdraw any moment in the study without consequences.</li>
	<li>If you plan on taking pictures/video, ask them if it’s ok that you are filming them and taking pictures and then have them sign the video release form (example file here: <a href="images/user-study/3-video-release-form.pdf" style="color:red"/>Video Release Form</a>)</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>Phase 2: Questionnaire about Prior Relevant Experience</h4>
<br>

It is a good idea to collect a few data points about participants before they start the study. However, <span style="color:red">you can never ask for participants *name*</span> since that would break anonymity. Always label participants as p1, p2, p3 etc.
<br><br> 

<ul>
	<li>give participants the pre-study questionnaire (example file here: <a href="images/user-study/pre-test-questionnaire.pdf" style="color:red"/>pre-study questionnaire</a>)</li>
	<li>our questionnaire includes: age, gender, height, dominant hand, prior experience with basketball, prior experience with other ball sports)</li>
</ul>

<br> 

<h4>Phase 3: Demonstration of System by Experimenters</h4>
<br>

Many studies have the experimenter first demonstrate the functionality of the prototype. For instance, in the adaptive basketball, we could throw a few balls and then show how the basketball adapts the hoop and stand. <br><br>

This typically helps to put participants at ease since they now have a better idea what they are supposed to be doing and what's going to happen in the study.<br><br>

<h4>Phase 4: Training of Participant</h4>
<br>

Participants can use some time to familiarize themselves with the interface. For instance, in our study they could throw some balls at the basket, see how it adapts. 
<br><br>

Tell participants that they can take as much time as they want at this stage before you will ask them to start the actual task.

<br> <br> 

<h4>Phase 5: Actual Task</h4>
<br>

We think it would be a lot to ask of you to run a full quantitative study with statistical analysis, so we will keep it at the qualitative level + collect some sensor data.<br><br>

Here's what we recommend you could do:
<br><br>

<b>Create 2 Conditions</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Condition 1 (adaptive): your adaptive prototype</li>
	<li>Condition 2 (static): your prototype but without adaptation (just disable the code that does the adaptation</li>
</ul>

<br>

<b>Choose a Task</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>e.g. have people throw 20 balls at the basket, darts at the dartboard</li>
	<li><span style="color:red">TAs can you check with your teams what would be a reasonable task that works with the implementation they have?</span></li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Randomly Assign Participants to Condition Orders</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>participants should use both conditions</li>
	<li>you need to randomly assign participants an order (e.g. condition 1 first, then condition 2 or vice versa) to avoid ordering effects</span></li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Log the Sensor Values + Actuation with Timestamps</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>while participants perform the task, write the sensor values and when the actuation happened either into a text file or onto the serial monitor</li>
	<li>we will use this information later to create some charts</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<h4>Phase 6: Post-Study Questionnaire</h4>
<br>

<ul>
	<li>give participants the post-study questionnaire (example file here: <a href="images/user-study/post-test-questionnaire.pdf" style="color:red"/>post-study questionnaire</a>)</li>
	<li>our questionnaire includes: if you got the change to keep practicing, would you choose the adaptive setup or the traditional setup? what made you come to this conclusion? anything we can improve with the system? any specific moments in the learning process you found memorable?</li>
	<li>when we run studies, we typically have participants fill out the questionnaire by themselves first, then when they give us the questionnaire we have another 3-5 minute de-briefing, i.e. we ask them to elaborate verbally on the points they jotted down (very useful to get more context around the comments on the questionnaire + some people don't like to write a lot but love to speak with you about the prototype)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 5: Report Results</h3>

You may want to report both qualitative and quantitative results.<br><br>

<b>qualitative results example (questionnaire)</b>:<br>

<i>Seeing the physical tool adapt: </i>‘The adaptive training made me reflect upon what I'm doing wrong by physically changing the height and hoop size and made me want to change my throwing style faster.’ (p3), 'Adaptive training makes each stage of training experience more rewarding so it helped me focus better.' (p11), 'Adaptive mode let me see gradual progress, while non-adaptive mode just felt like either shots that were too easy or an exercise in futility.' (p8), ‘Changes with the hoop was cool […] like having a personal trainer motivate me […] when it was getting tighter, I would think I'm doing good, when it got loose I would think I should do better’ (p7). <br><br>

<i>Having adaptive difficulty levels: </i>‘adaptive mode felt more useful in slowly adjusting to let me get better at harder and harder shots’ (p8). ‘it's more natural! [...] it matches learning process better’ (p7). However, one participant also mentioned 'I prefer to be challenged beyond my current capability and learn that way.' (p10) <br><br>

<i>Variety of training vs. specific movements: </i>Some participants stated that they might perform better by only practicing on the hard condition. ‘I feel like I get better if I just practice with hard level and nothing else’ (p5). ‘[while] adaptive training is more interesting, non-adaptive training helps me improve specific movements’ (p4). While these comments are correctly reflecting participants’ perspectives, it is known that varied practice outperforms practice with a fixed task, i.e., learners learn better when trained on a variety of settings in comparison to training on a specific goal task [13].<br><br>
