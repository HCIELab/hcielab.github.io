          When learning how to score baskets in basketball, beginner-level learners often train with basketball stands that are height-adjustable since a lower basket is easier to score. Learners can manually raise or lower the stand to increase or decrease difficulty. To be able to vary the task difficulty under computer-control, our adaptive basketball setup has a motor in the base that can raise and lower the stand based on input from a micro-controller. To give the prototype an additional dimension for adaptation, we also made the hoop adjustable, i.e., the hoop can widen and tighten using a second motor.

				To be able to determine how learners perform, the basketball stand has two sensors: a piezo sensor on the board to detect hits on the board, and a switch on the net that gets pulled when the ball falls through to detect scored baskets. All sensors and actuators are connected to a micro-controller (Arduino Uno) included in the base.

			<!-- 	In the exploratory study, participants attempted 80 throws with both the adaptive basketball and a static setup but were randomly assigned an order.
In the adaptive setup, participants started by throwing balls in the easiest setting (lowest basket height and largest hoop size) and gradually progressed to the harder settings (using an early version of our adaptation algorithm). 
In the static setup, participant attempted 40 throws for the easiest setting (i.e., largest hoop, lowest basket height) and then another 40 throws for the hardest setting (i.e., the smallest hoop and the highest basket height). 
At the beginning of the study and after each condition, we tested participants’ current skill level by asking them to attempt 20 throws in the hardest setup. At the end of the study, we collected qualitative feedback asking participants to compare their experience with the static setup to their experience with the adaptive setup.
We recruited twelve participants (8 female, 4 male) with ages between 18-31 years (mean=25, s=3.3). 
When participants were asked if they would rather retrain with the adaptive or the static setup, 8 out 12 participants preferred the adaptive setup. Following are quotes written by participants when asked to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of each condition.
Seeing the physical tool adapt: ‘The adaptive training made me reflect upon what I'm doing wrong by physically changing the height and hoop size and made me want to change my throwing style faster.’ (p3), 'Adaptive training makes each stage of training experience more rewarding so it helped me focus better.' (p11), 'Adaptive mode let me see gradual progress, while non-adaptive mode just felt like either shots that were too easy or an exercise in futility.' (p8), ‘Changes with the hoop was cool […] like having a personal trainer motivate me […] when it was getting tighter, I would think I'm doing good, when it got loose I would think I should do better’ (p7). 
Having adaptive difficulty levels: ‘adaptive mode felt more useful in slowly adjusting to let me get better at harder and harder shots’ (p8). ‘it's more natural! [...] it matches learning process better’ (p7). However, one participant also mentioned 'I prefer to be challenged beyond my current capability and learn that way.' (p10) 
Variety of training vs. specific movements: Some participants stated that they might perform better by only practicing on the hard condition. ‘I feel like I get better if I just practice with hard level and nothing else’ (p5). ‘[while] adaptive training is more interesting, non-adaptive training helps me improve specific movements’ (p4). While these comments are correctly reflecting participants’ perspectives, it is known that varied practice outperforms practice with a fixed task, i.e., learners learn better when trained on a variety of settings in comparison to training on a specific goal task [13].
While the main focus of this study was to collect qualitative feedback on adaptive training aids, our logged performance data shows that in the static condition, participants’ performance dropped significantly as soon as they switched from the easiest to the hardest setting. The fact that learners struggle with transfer learning when the training aid is removed is well known and highlights the importance to help users transition from a guided to an unguided state by gradually adapting the training aid over time (see Schmidt et al. [27]).   -->
