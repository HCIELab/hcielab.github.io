			<h3 class="headline">What do we look for in a UROP / MEng?</h3>
			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>When getting started in our lab, UROPs / MEng students typically start out by supporting one of our PhD students or postdocs on their research project.</li>
				<li>These research projects will be submitted for publication at the top HCI conferences ACM CHI and ACM UIST with the UROP / MEng-es co-authoring the papers and in some cases also traveling to the conference to give part of the talk or a live demo.</li>
				<li>We only look for UROPs/MEng-es seriously interested in becoming part of our research group. Each research project is important for the career of one of our PhD students or postdocs--we rely on each UROP and MEng to be a reliable team member and committed to making the project a success.</li>
				<li>In turn, you will be a member of a family-style research team with great mentoring, learn many new skills, and have a professional looking project on your portfolio.</li>
				<li>While we love to hear your own project ideas, the standard path in our lab is to first join an on-going research project with a senior mentor (PhD student or postdoc). Identifying a novel research contribution often takes years of training and is even a hard task for a mid-level PhD student.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 class="headline">UROP: Time Commitment + Pay/Credits</h3>
			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>UROPs will work ca. 8-10 hours per week. We care about outcomes and do not track your hours. However, we expect everyone to be present in the lab for most of this time to keep the communication paths short.</li>
				<li>You can do your UROP for pay or for credit.</li>
				<li>Please reach out before the following deadlines: spring semester: February 1, summer semester: April 1, fall semester: September 1, IAP: December 1).</li>
				<li>What if I don't have the skills yet? We do not expect you to already know everything--if you love the project and you are willing to put in the energy and time, we will be happy to teach you the necessary skills.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 class="headline">MEng: Time Commitment + Pay</h3>
			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>MEng-es are expected to spend at least 20 hours per week on their project. We care about outcomes and do not track your hours. However, we expect everyone to be present in the lab for most of this time to keep the communication paths short.</li>
				<li>You can do 2-, 3-, or 4-semester MEng-Thesis projects.</li>
				<li>Before applying to the lab, you need to have secured a TA position since we don't have funding to support MEng students (please mention the TA position in your email).</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 class="headline">Application Process</h3>
			<hr>
			If you are interested in working with us, send Prof. Mueller an email with the following:
			<ul>
				<li>what position you are interested in (UROP/MEng)</li>
				<li>when you would like to start</li>
				<li>your CV</li>
				<li>a website showing your previous projects or a project portfolio as pdf</li>
				<li>your latest grade transcript</li>
				<li>two names of people who we can ask for a short recommendation (e.g., previous UROP or internship mentors)</li>
			</ul>

			Prof. Mueller will then forward your materials to her PhD students and Postdocs who will then get back to you in case they have an opening. To get an idea of the type of projects our UROPs and MEng-es work on, you can read more below or go to the publication list on our homepage.<br><br>

				<b>Yashaswini Makaram (UROP):</b>
				I worked to develop modular robots that maneuvered using electromagnets. I have also been working on a project to stochastically assemble configurations using programmable magnets. Both of these projects require a lot of interdisciplinary work. I needed to pull together knowledge from physics, mathematics, and electrical engineering in order to find solutions. Along the way I had to discover not only the solutions to unanswered questions, but also had to contend with questions that had not been asked in the first place. From this Research opportunity, I realised how deep and broad  research can be and how to contend with unexpected results.

				<b>Leon Cheng (MEng):</b>
				I designed and developed a 3D interactive simulation for the project's focus on magnetic cube block assembly. Reconfigurations of multiple Electrovoxel cubes are difficult to coordinate because every cube's set of magnets is reoriented with a rotation in space and adjacent magnets must be carefully coordinated to produce the correct strength and duration of magnetic attraction or repulsion. Therefore, building a Javascript to Arduino program that can simulate the physics and follow UX heuristics was able to vitally simplify the level of thinking required for large reconfigurations. I also supported the mechanical assembly of physical cubes using custom wrapped electromagnets for the specially designed physical cube.

				<b>Olivia Seow (SM):</b> MetaSense integrates sensing into 3D printable metamaterial structures by fabricating specific cell walls from conductive filament, thereby creating capacitive sensors. Olivia worked on and improved the web-based editor to create these structures. She developed the algorithm for analyzing deformations in the cell structures, in order to identify most optimal locations for placing conductive cell walls during the design phase. She prototyped the algorithm in a standalone three.js environment, and integrated it on the editor with Karamba, a finite element solver in Grasshopper. Using this editor, she designed and 3D printed mechanisms to showcase Metasense and its integrated sensing capabilities, experimenting with and identifying 3D printer specifications for fabricating robust structures. She helped to visualize the capacitances of the cell structures to characterize their performance. She was involved with the whole research process, creating figures, videos, and writing for the publication as co-first author.

			<b>Christina Liao (MEng):</b> Christina developed the software pipeline for a novel fabrication method that uses a laser cutter to automatically create fully-functional devices that work immediately after fabrication is complete. The software pipeline she designed consists of a design interface, in which users can define the circuitry and geometry of the device to fabricate, and a post-processing system that transforms the design into machine instructions that a laser cutter uses to fabricate the device. With this pipeline, users can design and fabricate high-fidelity devices without needing to know the specifics behind the fabrication process. <br>

				<b>Jackson Snowden (UROP):</b> I created a capacitive touch sensing driver on an Arduino platform for sensing interactions with sprayed-on contacts. Then, touch inputs were used to drive Philips Hue lights using a custom Python script and to play audio using an Arduino-SD card interface.
    			I also created a touch display driver by utilizing a switching circuit to deliver power to an electroluminescent display while receiving touch input from the same display. This required me to design and fabricate a custom circuit as well as write extensive Arduino software to drive the circuit. Later, I adapted the existing touch sensing driver to do proximity sensing. This involved several filtering techniques to attain maximum sensitivity while rejecting 60 Hz noise from the surroundings. This new software was used to detect swipe gestures and control a photo album. Tools/Programming Languages used: This project primarily required me to use low-level C to get high performance from the Arduino. I was also able to prototype some simple circuits, create a multi-layer PCB design, and fabricate the final PCB by hand.

				I started by researching, designing, and iterating on a computer vision algorithm to detect the shape of a 3D printed object’s internal structure. This meant several tries at finding the right algorithm, as well as lots of learning about how to clean up noisy images to get something the algorithm could even work on in the first place. Then, once I had a working Python prototype for the algorithm, I rewrote it in C++, and wrote an Android app which used that C++ code on images from the phone’s camera to detect the internal structure. I also incorporated another computer vision algorithm written by Doga, which was based on 2D Fourier transforms.

<h4>10) AR Games for Learning Prototyping Skills (with Dishita)</h4><br>
<b>Topic:</b> AR games have been proven to provide better learning experience for various skills in classrooms. In this project, we develop AR based game interface to teach novices prototyping skills such as laser-cutting, 3D printing, breadboarding and other basic maker-skills. As the learner plays a game, various personalized props get released during the game-play that are designed to improve the learner's prototyping skills. At the end of the project, we expect to run a user-study to assess the learning gain of learners.  <br>
<b>Your job:</b> As a UROP/MEng, you will be working on either hardware (for applications in other domains) or software (for seamless synchronization of sensors and actuators for amateurs). Skills for hardware side application: Rhino3D, prototyping with arduino, basic digital fabrication (lasercutting/3D printing), basic MechE building (using workshop tools, soldering circuits etc) and basic electronics (working with sensors/actuators etc). For Software side application: Unity3D, Vuforia, python, C# or VB Scripting, 3D Rhino, Grasshopper, Blender etc. Interest in games and having worked with Hololens or any other AR/VR device is a plus.  -->
