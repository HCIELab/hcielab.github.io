			<h3 class="headline">What do we look for in a UROP / MEng?</h3>
			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>When getting started in our lab, UROPs / MEng students typically start out by supporting one of our PhD students or postdocs on their research project.</li>
				<li>These research projects will be submitted for publication at the top HCI conferences ACM CHI and ACM UIST with the UROP / MEng-es co-authoring the papers and in some cases also traveling to the conference to give part of the talk or a live demo.</li>
				<li>We only look for UROPs seriously interested in becoming part of our research group. Each research project is important for the career of one of our PhD students or postdocs--we rely on each UROP and MEng to be a reliable team member and committed to making the project a success.</li>
				<li>In turn, you will be a member of a family-style research team with great mentoring, learn many new skills, and have a professional looking project on your portfolio.</li>
				<li>While we love to hear your own project ideas, please understand that the standard path in our lab is to first join an on-going research project with a senior mentor (PhD student or postdoc). Identifying a novel research contribution often takes years of training and is even a hard task for a mid-level PhD student.</li>
			</ul> 

		<h3 class="headline">UROP: Time Commitment + Pay/Credits</h3>
			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>UROPs will work ca. 8-10 hours per week. We care about outcomes and do not track your hours. However, we expect everyone to be present in the lab for most of this time to keep the communication paths short.</li>
				<li>You can do your UROP for pay or for credit.</li>
				<li>Please reach out before the following deadlines: spring semester: February 1, summer semester: April 1, fall semester: September 1, IAP: December 1).</li>
				<li>What if I don't have the skills yet? We do not expect you to already know everything--if you love the project and you are willing to put in the energy and time, we will be happy to teach you the necessary skills.</li>
			</ul> 

		<h3 class="headline">MEng: Time Commitment + Pay</h3>
			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>MEng-es are expected to spend at least 20 hours per week on their project. We care about outcomes and do not track your hours. However, we expect everyone to be present in the lab for most of this time to keep the communication paths short.</li>
				<li>You can do 2-, 3-, or 4-semester MEng-Thesis projects.</li>
				<li>Before applying to the lab, you need to have secured a TA position since we don't have enough funding to support MEng students (please mention the TA position in your email).</li>
			</ul> 

		<h3 class="headline">Application Process</h3>
			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>send an email to Prof. Mueller including the information below</li>
				<li>your CV</li>
				<li>a website showing your previous projects or a project portfolio as pdf</li>
				<li>your latest grade transcript</li>
				<li>two names of people who Prof. Mueller can ask for a short recommendation (e.g., previous UROP or internship mentors)</li>
				<li>when you would like to start</li>
				<li>a ranking of up to 3 projects from the list of on-going projects below (list your preferred project first)</li>

			<h4>1) MorphSensor Electronics Fabrication (with Junyi and Lotta)</h4><br>
<b>Topic:</b> In this project, we are building an interactive device prototyping platform that brings design object and electronic sensors (IMU sensor, distance sensor etc.) into a same 3D workspace. The users are then able to edit the bulky sensor modules, along with the 3D target object, into freeform shape, as well as the electronic components lay-outs, in order to fit into specific space constraint and have better functionality performance. We also have a whole fabrication pipeline implementing right now for the finished design. This lowers the barrier for personal interactive device design, and unlocks more design freedom for interactive prototypes. Right now the software system is close to finish, but definitely needs polishing; on the hardware side there isn’t a fixed fabrication workflow yet, we are actively trying different fabrication methods for the finished design, including 3D printing, InkJet printing and possibly laser “printing”. 
 <br>
<b>Your job:</b> You will help us develop and polish a Rhino plugin that serves as bridge between Rhino and EAGLE, if you prefer to work more on software. You can also help us build some electronic sensor modules (essentially PCBs) and interactive prototypes.
You will work with 1)software side: Rhino Grasshopper, EAGLE; 2)hardware side: 3D printers, some electronic sensors with Arduino.
Ideally you have done some PCB designing and/or 3D modeling before. It will also help if you have built some interactive devices/systems with microprocessor/micro-controller (Arduino, Raspberry Pi etc.) before. Some experience with Python and C-like languages.

<br><br>


	<h4>2) Making 3D Printing Easier: Merging 3D Modeling & Slicing (with Kenny and Carolyn)</h4><br>
<b>Topic:</b> Why is it so difficult to get started with 3D printing? Why does preparing a 3D print take so long? In this set of projects, we are exploring ways to make 3D printing faster, easier, and more powerful. Currently, the process of designing and preparing 3d models to be printed is difficult and cumbersome. We are designing new software tools to tighten the feedback loop of creating 3d objects. We currently have multiple projects based on a new web-based 3D editor, and we are looking for new members to help develop and improve the software. You will help implement significant features in a large-scale new type of web-based 3D modeler and slicer.  <br>
<b>Your job:</b> The project is implemented in modern web technology (HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript), 3D JavaScript Libraries (Three.js, Web-Cad), and Python and C# back-ends (Flask server, and custom C# code). Ideally you have interest in 3D printing and 3D modeling and graphics, although this is not required. You should have a strong programming background, and should have implemented multiple projects in one or more of the following languages: JavaScript (or other web-based work), Python, or C#. This is a great project for anyone interested in 3D printing and creating complex software.

<br><br>

			<h4>3) Physical Adaptive Tools for Improved Learning (with Dishita)</h4><br>
<b>Topic:</b> In this project, we convert everyday objects into adaptive tools to enable personalized learning of motor skills. Some of the prototypes we have developed include an adaptive basketball stand (with changing height and hoop diameter), an adaptive bike (that raises and lowers its training wheels based on balancing skills), an adaptive wobbleboard (with automatic inflatable support) and an adaptive golf arm band. <br>
<b>Your job:</b> As a UROP/MEng, you will be working on either hardware (for applications in other domains) or software (for seamless synchronization of sensors and actuators for amateurs). Skills for hardware side application: Rhino3D, prototyping with arduino, basic digital fabrication (lasercutting/3D printing), basic MechE building (using workshop tools, soldering circuits etc) and basic electronics (working with sensors/actuators etc). For Software side application: python, C# or VB Scripting. 

<br><br>

			<h4>4) Exploiting 3D Print Properties for Identification  (with Doga)</h4><br>
<b>Topic:</b> 3D printed objects are everywhere. But how can we add unobtrusive unique labels (like an invisible QR code) to them if we have, say, a hundred copies of the same object, with the same shape? In this project, we investigate how undesired properties of 3D printing could be exploited to serve as a way to tag 3D printed objects. This comes in handy to allow for identification, authentication of fabricated objects, or enhance security of 3D printing. <br>
<b>Your job:</b> There are different ways in which you could contribute to this project. You may use a 3D printer to fabricate prototypes with hidden labels/tags (desired skills: <b>3D printing</b>, slicing software such as Cura, 3D modeling is preferred but not required). These labels may be visual, acoustic, or tactile (or they may have other characteristics too if you have a new idea!). We have been working on visual labels for a while and have got decent results. If you are interested in <b>computer vision</b>/image processing, you may help us further develop our algorithm. For acoustic labels, you could work on an audio processing algorithm to detect frequencies/pitches generated by 3D printed objects (<b>audio/sound/signal processing </b> experience might be helpful). Desired skills for this part would be C++/Python/MATLAB and/or iOS/Android development.

<br><br>

			<h4>5) Collective 3D Printing for Failure Handling (with Doga)</h4><br>
<b>Topic:</b> You start a 3D print that is going to take some time and leave the room. You come back six hours later to pick up your print to find that… the printer has failed. The worst feeling, right? In this project, we explore ways to avoid/handle 3D print failures. Currently, the printing process takes quite a long time and when the 3D printer fails you often have to restart the print. We envision that we can print things faster by distributing the burden among multiple printers. What can we reallocate such a distributed workload when one of those printers fails? And for that, how can we automatically detect that a 3D print is about to fail or has failed? In this way, we could notify users before something goes wrong and prevent potential breakdowns, and make 3D printing faster and more convenient. <br>
<b>Your job:</b> This project involves <b>software</b> and <b>hardware</b> development. <b>Graphics</b> and/or <b>optimization</b> theory might be very useful for some parts of this project. One part is to optimize the workload distributed among multiple 3D printers based on certain constraints (e.g. time, material used). You would be a good fit if you want to bring optimization theory to practice. You could implement an algorithm for that in Python/C++ or another language	you’d like. If you are interested in 3D modeling and computer graphics/vision, there are two things you could help us with: (1) you can help us efficiently partition 3D models, (2) you can help us automatically detect 3D printer failures based on live images captured by different types of cameras. <b>For the hardware part</b>, you can help us hack our 3D printer to do what we want, e.g. to stop when it’s about to malfunction. If you have unique ideas that you think might be relevant to the goal of this project, you are welcome to try them out! There’s a lot to discover in this project and it’s going to be fun!

<br><br>


			<h4>6) Color-Changing Coatings, Baths, and Resins/Filaments (with Yuhua and Isabel)</h4><br>
<b>Topic:</b> In most situations in the real world, once an object is fabricated, the color is permanent and cannot be changed again. In this project, we are trying to break through this limitation by using a kind of special dye, known as photochromic dye. This kind of dye can switch its appearance from transparent to colored status when exposed by high intensity UV light, and then maintain the color in natural environments. Also, the colored dye can switch back to the transparent status when exposed by the light with a specific wavelength in visible range. This color changing process is fully reversible and can be repeated infinitely. Currently, based on this mechanism, we intend to transform single-material 3D printing processes into multi-color printing processes that are high-resolution. The key idea is to mix photochromic dyes that can transition into any color into resins and filaments. By shining specific activation and deactivation wavelengths light onto the printed object, we will have the ability to re-color the printed object at the resolution of the light source.  <br>
<b>Your job:</b> There is a variety of work you can choose to be involved in: hardware development, software development, and hands-on experimentation. For hardware, you will help us develop a novel optical system or 3D printing system. For software, you will help us to develop projection mapping techniques or UI software. Other work may require you to do experiments and research on material preparation.In the project, you will be working with a branch of optical devices, DLP projection system, SLA 3D printer, PLA 3D printer, chemical mixing apparatuses, etc. Skills you will learn: image processing, computer vision, projection mapping, 3D printing.
