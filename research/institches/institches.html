          <span class="medium-headline">PAPER OVERVIEW</span>
          <br> There is a rapidly growing group of people learning to sew online. Without hands-on instruction, these learners are often left to discover the challenges and pitfalls of sewing.
          Sewing is difficult to master, and those who explore it without a guide are
          left to discover many of its challenges through trial and error. This
          can be expensive, as each mistake comes at a material cost that can
          become a limiting factor. 
          <br>
          <br>
          In other domains in which the consequences of individual mistakes can be high—for example, competitive sports, or musical performance—a common mitigating strategy is engagement in deliberate practice, which focuses on performing tasks designed to
          improve the learner’s skills in lower-stakes settings. For example,
          in sports athletes will repeatedly perform drills for specific techniques; while in music, performers will practice scales or repeatedly
          play the most challenging segments from a longer piece of music.
          In sewing, however, deliberate practice is surprisingly uncommon. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The effectiveness of practice depends on
          being able to identify useful low-cost practice tasks that target the
          abilities and objectives of individual learners. In sewing, this can
          be a tall order; learners usually do not generally know which tasks
          will be difficult, and even when they do, it can be unclear what form
          low-cost practice should take. Practice, after all, still requires fabric.
          As a result, practice is uncommon in sewing and often amounts to
          multiple unsuccessful attempts at a project. Our work focuses on understanding the challenges that make practice in sewing so rare and building a tool to help mitigate those
          challenges in existing workflows.
          <br>
          <br>
          We present InStitches, a software tool that augments existing sewing patterns with targeted practice tasks to guide users through the skills needed to complete their chosen project. InStitches analyzes the difficulty of sewing instructions relative to a user’s reported expertise in order to determine where practice will be helpful and then solves for a new pattern layout that incorporates additional practice steps while optimizing for efficient use of available materials. The design of InStitchesis driven by three key goals:
          <br>
          <br>

          <ol class="list-no-style">
          <li>Integration with existing workflows: Sewing is rich with
          tradition and established workflows. A system that is incompatible with these workflows is unlikely to have the same
          impact as one that complements them. With this in mind, InStitches is designed to work by augmenting existing sewing
          patterns and instructions.</li>

          <br>
          <li>Personalization: For many learners, a key barrier to incorporating practice in sewing is not being able to identify when
          practice is necessary in the first place. Most new learners discover that a stitching task is difficult only when they fail to
          perform it. To be useful, our system needs to identify which
          tasks will be difficult before those tasks are performed. This
          requires incorporating knowledge of both the user’s skill
          level and the relative difficulty of different tasks.</li>

          <br>
          <li>Efficient material use: A significant deterrent for practice in
          sewing is material use. Practice has a material cost, as one
          still needs fabric to practice on. Without careful planning,
          this cost can come to outweigh material saved by avoiding
          mistakes, so to benefit users, we need to ensure that the cost
          of practice remains low.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          The first of these goals aims to minimize barriers to adoption, while
          the second two highlight aspects of our problem that are particularly well-suited for integration with a computational tool. In the
          case of personalization, computation offers a way to relate sewing
          patterns and user skill assessments to information harvested from
          texts on sewing. In the case of material efficiency, it lets us frame
          pattern layout as a 2D optimization problem, and by solving for
          layouts that minimize overall material cost, we can preferentially
          generate patterns that re-purpose previously wasted fabric to create
          dedicated practice pieces. Users are
          able to choose among practice tasks generated using three different strategies, each offering different material trade-offs. Our user
          evaluation indicates that InStitches is able to identify challenging
          sewing tasks and augment existing sewing patterns with practice
          tasks that users find helpful. This helps makers explore the craft of
          sewing in the context of a project of their choice.
