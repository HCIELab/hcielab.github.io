We introduce Meta-antenna, a design and fabrication pipeline for creating frequency reconfigurable antennas while making use of a single type of mechanical metamaterial structure. Unlike traditional static antenna systems with fixed radiation patterns and frequency responses per geometry, Meta-antenna leverages mechanical reconfiguration to alter the radiation and geometry characteristics of the antenna, making it more versatile for sensing and communication. Meta-antenna provides a design space of resonance frequency from 500 MHz to 6.3 GHz (≥10dB) upon the structure's compression, bending, or rotation. Additionally, we provide an Ansys-based editor that allows users to generate metamaterial antenna geometries and simulate their resonance frequency. We also provide a code template for Meta-antenna based sensing interactions. Our technical evaluation demonstrates that our fabricated Meta-antenna structures remain functional even after 10,000 compression cycles. Finally, we contribute three example applications showcasing Meta-antenna’s potential in adaptive personal devices, smart home systems, and tangible user interfaces.

		INTRODUCTION
		</span>
        <br>
		<br>
        

Antennas are foundational to many technologies we rely on in our everyday lives; from the high-speed WiFi antennas on our smart phones, to the satellite dishes transmitting our favorite television shows, antennas are integral to the modern technologies that shape our everyday experiences.


<br> <br>
In recent years, the HCI community has demonstrated how antennas can be integrated into interactive systems. These systems
enable applications such as gesture recognition, energy transfer, and
mechanical motion sensing. For example, researchers have shown
how antennas can recognize human gestures and translate them
into movements of an avatar in XR applications [22 , 23], integrated
antennas into wearable devices for energy harvesting [33], and
illustrated how antennas can be used as encoders for mechanical
motion tracking [18]. The function and performance of the antennas are largely dependent on the antenna’s ability to efficiently radiate, which is determined by several factors like the antenna’s
geometry [31], material [34], and operating environment [15].
<br> <br>


Traditionally, antennas are designed with fixed geometries, i.e.,
a single geometric configuration corresponding to fixed Radiofrequency (RF) properties. For example, the patch antenna designs in PrintedWifi [18] track mechanical rotations, but they are static
antennas with fixed resonant frequencies and radiation patterns.
Although fixed geometry antennas are suitable for certain use cases,
they are less effective for broader applications, such as environment-adaptive sensing [36], mode switching between data transmission and reception [7], and development of dynamic antennas that seam-
lessly operate across a range of network protocols [29]. This limitation in static antenna capabilities highlights the need to design dynamic antennas that alter their radiation characteristics.


<br> <br>
To address this, researchers developed reconfigurable antennas
that can adjust their RF parameters while adopting a single antenna structure. One approach uses mechanical reconfiguration
which relies on physically altering the geometry of an antenna to
tune its function and performance. Such mechanically reconfigurable systems utilize actuators, like motors, to move assemblies of linkages [30], gears [30, 32] and ground planes [9].
<br> 

However, actuation-based mechanical methods can quickly increase the mechanical complexity of reconfigurable antenna systems, especially if the designed antenna must support multiple motion primitives such as bending, expansion, and rotation. 
To address these limitations, we propose a mechanical building block structure that supports these motion primitives, while guaranteeing simplified designs for mechanically reconfigurable antennas.


<br> <br>
Mechanical metamaterials are one flavor of building block structures that have been explored within HCI for various interactive applications [14 , 17]. These metamaterials can be programmed to
adopt different physical shapes [25] and support multiple motion
primitives such as bending, expansion, and rotation. Researchers
have even leveraged these structures to build mechanically reconfigurable antennas, eliminating the need for bulky multi-component mechanical assemblies. Existing work have primarily explored how
incremental compressions for a single mechanical metamaterial
structure affects resonant frequency and radiation pattern, without
exploring how changes in geometry or other interactions, like rotation, influence antenna behavior. [3, 37]. In other words, current metamaterial antenna systems do not utilize the full expressive power of metamaterials. Metamaterial structures have the potential, through reversible changes in their geometric state, to be designed as reconfigurable antenna that adapt to various interaction paradigms. Thus, the design and fabrication of programmable metamaterial antennas and how they can be applied to various primitive interactions remain under-explored.



<br> <br>

In this paper, we explore the design, implementation, and evaluation of a mechanically reconfigurable patch antenna based on metamaterial structures.  We demonstrate how this type of metamaterial structure can dynamically adjust the antenna frequency by changes in (1) antenna geometry length, (2) presence of dynamic holes \& slits, and (3) multi-state pattern configurations. \added{Despite these structural modifications, the Meta-antenna retains its fundamental capabilities as an antenna, capable of its original functions such as wireless communication and sensing.}  We also contribute a design tool that enables users to generate reconfigurable metamaterial antennas. Additionally, we provide five technical evaluations covering our fabrication technique, the electrical durability of the Meta-antenna structures, and our design tool's simulation results. We also introduce three example applications on adaptive electronic devices, smart furniture, and tangible user interfaces that showcase how our proposed reconfigurable metamaterial antennas can be applied to everyday use cases.

META-ANTENNA: SENSING AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES		</span>
		<br>
		<br>
        
        Meta-antennas are mechanically reconfigurable antennas that are
engineered to take on specific configurations. The key idea is to
integrate the antenna into a mechanical metamaterial that can
reconfigure the antenna properties by deforming the antenna geometry. In this section, we first provide background on the antenna radio-frequency properties we aim to reconfigure, then provide an
overview of our Meta-antenna structure and design criteria.
        
       
        <br>
        <br>


        <b> Sensing Principle </b>
Meta-antennas are frequency reconfigurable antennas. Mechanically deforming the antenna structure shifts its resonance frequency,i.e. the frequency at which it resonates or is the least lossless at,
shifts. The amount of power that the antenna loses or transmits as
a function of frequency is denoted as the antenna’s return loss, measured in decibels (dB). The more negative this dB value is, the less lossy the antenna is. For our Meta-antenna frequency reconfiguration to be significant we set two cut-off values based on literature: (1) a cut-off value for the antenna return loss magnitude, (2) a cut-off
value for the percentage change in resonance frequency.

SENSING PRINCIPLE	</span>
<br> <br> 

  <p>Meta-antennas are frequency reconfigurable antennas. Mechanically deforming the antenna structure shifts its resonance frequency, i.e. the frequency at which it resonates or is the least lossless at, shifts. The amount of power that the antenna loses or transmits as a function of frequency is denoted as the antenna's <em>return loss</em>, measured in decibels (dB). The more negative this dB value is, the less lossy the antenna is. For our Meta-antenna frequency reconfiguration to be <em>significant</em> we set two cut-off values based on literature: (1) a cut-off value for the antenna return loss magnitude, (2) a cut-off value for the percentage change in resonance frequency.</p>

  <p class="small-gap"><strong>Antenna Return Loss Cut-off</strong>: The cut-off we use for determining whether a resonant frequency is worth considering or not is -10db. This value corresponds to a power loss of less than 10%, and is an acceptable cut-off for antenna return loss based on literature.</p>

  <p><strong>Antenna Percentage Change in Resonance Frequency</strong>: Percentage change in resonance frequency (PCRF) measures how much the Meta-antenna's resonant frequency shifts upon reconfiguration.</p>

  <!-- src: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Percent-change-of-the-resonance-frequency-versus-bending-radius-bending-along-the-l_fig16_272093509 -->

  <p>	The PCRF is given by:</p>

  <p>$$\frac{\Delta f}{f_0} \times 100\%$$</p>

  <p>where \( \Delta f \) is the frequency shift and \( f_0 \) is the original resonant frequency.</p>

  <p>Based on literature, we break down frequency shifts to three categories:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Small shifts (&lt; 1%)</strong>: Ideal for static environments with minimal mechanical movement. Examples include antenna for ice and water detection or temperature sensing.</li>
    <li><strong>Moderate shifts (1–5%)</strong>: Suitable for mechanical deformations of building structures  or as strain sensors in flexible antenna.</li>
    <li><strong>Significant shifts (&gt; 5%)</strong>: Suitable for mechanically reconfigurable antenna like sliding motion antenna, and folding mechanical antenna.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="noindent">For Meta-antennas, we set the percentage shift to be no less than 1%, as these shifts are compatible with mechanical motion.</p>

  <p class="small-gap">Meta-antenna relies on resonant frequency shifts caused by deformation as a basis for its sensing principle. To determine the antenna's resonant frequency, we sweep our antenna through a frequency range of 500 MHz to 6.3 GHz and record the frequencies where the -10dB cut-off occurs. When the antenna deforms into a new geometric configuration, the resonant frequency shifts from the previous configuration. For a shift to be considered significant in mechanical applications, it must meet our predefined PCRF criteria.</p>



         <span class="medium-headline"> 
META-ANTENNA DESIGN PRINCIPLES	</span>
<br> <br> 

  <p>Motivated by research on reconfigurable antenna design principles and metamaterial structures, we developed the following design criteria. Our criteria are segmented into (1) mechanical design goals and (2) radio-frequency design goals. For the mechanical design goals, we identify the following for our meta-antenna structures:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>DG1:</strong> the structure mechanically deforms and the deformation is programmable</li>
    <li><strong>DG2:</strong> the structure is mechanically and structurally stable</li>
    <li><strong>DG3:</strong> the structure accomodates different user interaction primitives such as compression, bending, and rotation</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="noindent">We use the frequency shift categorization and return loss cut-off we introduced in <a href="#sec-sensing-principle">Section&nbsp;Sensing Principle</a> to inform our radio-frequency criteria for Meta-antenna based sensing:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>DG4:</strong> the structure has at least one resonant frequency that is within the acceptable return loss cut-off (≤ -10dB)</li>
    <li><strong>DG5:</strong> the structure's mechanical deformation results in moderate to significant change in the antenna's frequency (PCRF &gt; 1%)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="noindent">Based on these design criteria, we chose the following metamaterial and antenna structures:</p>

  <p class="small-gap"><strong>Metamaterial (Kirigami Auxetic Structures):</strong> To meet our design goals, we chose kirigami auxetic metamaterials. These metamaterials comprise patternable cells with periodic cut designs that allow them to achieve different deformations through compression, bending, and rotation when deployed (<strong>DG3</strong>) (Figure 2). The connection point between cells creates a four-bar linkage which makes the structure mechanically stable (<strong>DG2</strong>). This allows cells to rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise and take on specific configurations that create different deformations (<strong>DG1, DG3</strong>).</p>

            <br></div> <b>
	Figure 2: Meta-antenna structures support different user interaction primitives like expansion, retraction, bending, and
rotation.
		</b>  
      
<br><br><br>


<p class="small-gap"><strong>Antenna Type (Patch Antennas):</strong> For the antenna, we chose patch antennas, which are a planar type of antenna that can be patterned onto the previously selected metamaterial cell structures. Since our metamaterial geometries consist of planar cell structures, planar antennas are particularly suitable to be integrated onto the cell faces. As our metamaterial structure deforms, the geometry of the patch antenna changes, resulting in different antenna radiation characteristics (<strong>DG4, DG5</strong>).</p>

  <p class="small-gap">Next, we outline how changing specific geometric dimensions in a patch antenna influences its radio-frequency (RF) properties.</p>

<br><br>
         <span class="medium-headline"> 
PATCH STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES </span>
<br> <br> 

  <p>Traditional patch antennas consist of three layers: a dielectric layer sandwiched between two conductive layers. As shown in Figure 3</a>, these layers include the top conductive layer (resonating patch), the dielectric layer (substrate), and the bottom conductive layer (ground plane). Because of this simple structure and material composition, patch antennas can be easily fabricated on both 3D printers and laser cutters.</p>



        <div class="center"><img src="images/structure.png" width="70%" style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-bottom:10px"/> 
            <br></div> <b>


	Figure 3: The basic structure of a patch antenna consists of a dielectric layer (substrate) sandwiched between two layers of conductive materials (resonating patch and ground).
		</b>  
      
<br><br><br>


  <p>The antenna's RF properties are affected by: (1) the shape of its patch, (2) its length, and (3) the presence of holes and slits.</p>

  <p class="small-gap"><strong>Antenna Patch Shape:</strong> Patch antenna properties are significantly impacted by the overall shape of the antenna's patch, i.e., the pattern of the resonating patch design on the substrate. For example, Figure 4 shows a bowtie vs a square antenna integrated into the same square structure. Different antenna patch patterns yield distinct resonance frequencies \cite{antennashapepattern}. Therefore, an antenna that results in three different patch patterns upon rotational deformation (Figure 4) yields different resonance frequencies even though it is embedded in a <em>single</em> fabricated structure.</p>




        <div class="center"><img src="images/rotate.png" width="70%" style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-bottom:10px"/> 
            <br></div> <b>


	Figure 4: Meta-antennas have three rotational states with 45-degree symmetry from their expanded state (State-1). Each configuration alters the pattern and resonant frequency.
		</b>  
      
<br><br><br>




  <p class="small-gap"><strong>Antenna Length:</strong> The length of the antenna refers to the longest side of the patch antenna substrate. The length of a patch antenna has a significant impact on its RF properties. The greater the antenna length, the lower the resonating frequencies. By integrating the patch antenna into a meta-material, we can significantly change its length as the metamaterial deforms (Figure 5).</p>



  <p class="small-gap"><strong>Presence of Holes and Slits:</strong> The introduction of slits and holes into a patch antenna can also either shift its resonance frequency or generate multiple resonant frequencies within a specific range. This is in contrast to a <em>solid patch antenna</em>. Since our metamaterial structure is an auxetic kirigami geometry with cut patterns, it intrinsically introduces small slits into the antenna when it retracts, and larger holes as it expands (Figure 2) </a>).</p>


           <div class="center"><img src="images/expansion.png" width="70%" style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-bottom:10px"/>

while (b) shows an expansion rate of 809% for a rectangular
Meta-antenna with a 13:1 length to width ratio.
		</b></div> 
        <br> <br> 

  <p class="small-gap">In summary, to ensure that our metamaterial structures meet our design goals, we opted for a rotating grid structure because it (1) can achieve beyond <em>222%</em> reported change in length \cite{kirigamiauxeticstretch2017} (<strong>DG1</strong>) (2) can rotate to three different configurations and thus result in different antenna patch shapes across these rotational configurations (<strong>DG1, DG3</strong>), and (3) is structurally stable since the hinges between the cells of the structure form a four-bar linkage mechanism (<strong>DG2</strong>).</p>



     <span class="medium-headline">
DESIGN PARAMETERS
        </span>
		<br>
		<br>
In this section, we discuss key design parameters related to the
construction of Meta-antenna geometries. We explore the different Meta-antenna states, how Meta-antenna expansion rate can
be tuned, and the effects of Meta-antenna unit cell density on its structure. The goal of this section is to establish the effect of tuning these design parameters on Meta-antennas both mechanically and with respect to resonance frequency
<br><br>
             

<b> Antenna States <b> : Antenna states refer to the different geometrical configuration that a Meta-antenna assumes upon its deformation. Meta-antennas have three states that they deform into:
an expanded state (State-1) and two retracted states (States 2 and
3) as shown in Figure 4. A retracted meta-antenna refers to a deformed structure with the unit cells closely packed (i.e., no gaps), whereas an expanded meta-antenna means the structure is spread
out, creating holes between the unit cells (Figure 2). The initial state that the antenna is fabricated in affects the mag-
nitude of motion needed to reach other states. If the user fabricates
the meta-antenna in its expanded state (State-1), the meta-antenna cells only need to move 45◦ clockwise or counter-clockwise to reach the other two states. However, if the user fabricates the antenna in its retracted State-2, the meta-antenna cells go through a 90◦ rotation in order to reach State-3, which adds more strain on the hinges connecting the unit cells (Figure 4). In summary, we recommend designing Meta-antennas in their
expanded state if the goal is to trigger changes through retraction,
with two possible configurations (clockwise and counterclockwise).
If the aim is to simply expand or retract the structure to trigger
changes, we recommend designing antennas in their retracted state.
Finally, the change of states affects the antenna’s resonant frequency since the antenna length changes, as well as the pattern as long as State 2 and 3 are non-identical (Figure 4).

<br> <br> 

<b> Meta-antenna Expansion Rate <b> : The expansion rate of a Meta-antenna refers to the maximum amount the antenna moves between State-1 and States 2-3 (Figure 5). The ratio of the unit cell’s length and width in a Meta-antenna structure affects its expansion rate. The relationship between the expansion rate of the Meta-antenna
structure and its unit cells’ length to width ratio is defined as:



<p>
\[
\text{Expansion Rate} = \frac{W_{\text{exp}} - W_{\text{ret}}}{W_{\text{ret}}}
\]
Where \( W_{\text{exp}} \) is the expanded width and \( W_{\text{ret}} \) is the retracted width of the system.
</p>

<p>
The full expansion rate formula we derived is as follows:
</p>

<p>
\[
\text{Expansion Rate} =
\left(
 \left( W_{\text{ret}} - n_w \left( \frac{s}{2} \right) \right)
 \left( \alpha (1 + r) - 1 \right)
 + (n_w - 1) \left( s - \alpha H \right)
 - \frac{n_w s}{2}
\right)
\cdot
\frac{1}{W_{\text{ret}}}
\]
</p>

<p>
Where \( \alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), \( r = \frac{u_L}{u_W} \) is the ratio of unit length to unit width, \( n_w \) is the number of unit cells along the width (Meta-antenna \( y \)-density), \( s \) is the antenna slit size, and \( H \) is the hinge size.
</p>

<p>
This equation tells us that the smaller \( r \) is, the smaller the expansion rate for the structure. Conversely, a larger \( r \) results in a higher expansion rate for the antenna width. The smallest expansion rate, for a fixed number of units with \( u_L > u_W \), occurs at \( r = 1 \), indicating a square structure. Otherwise, if \( u_W > u_L \) the ratio flips as shown in Figure 6-b.
</p>



           <div class="center"><img src="images/rect-sqr.png" width="65%" style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-bottom:10px"/> 
            <br><b>

while (b) shows an expansion rate of 809% for a rectangular
Meta-antenna with a 13:1 length to width ratio.
		</b></div> 
        <br> <br> 


 <b> Meta-antenna Density <b>: Meta-antenna density refers to the
total number of unit cells by row and column in a given area (nxm).
For example, a 3x2 Meta-antenna density refers to a structure with
3 unit cells per row and 2 unit cells per column.
For a given Meta-antenna size, the minimum Meta-antenna
density is 2x1 or 1x2. Increasing the density causes the the Meta- antenna structure to become more rigid against compression thereby increasing the amount of force required to actuate the antenna. The proportional relationship is between Meta-antenna density and force of actuation is as follows:
        

  <p>
    \[
      F \propto \frac{n}{D}
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    Where \( n \) is the number of Meta-antenna units in the \( x \) or \( y \)-direction,
    and \( D \) is the width or length of the Meta-antenna.
  </p>

        <br> <br> 
        

However, we note that while increasing Metantenna density increases the compression force, it also makes the structure easier to bend. In terms of antenna resonant frequency, the higher the density of a Meta-antenna in its State-1, the less its frequency response deviates from that of a solid antenna patch of the same size.

Based on solid patch antenna designs, we set the maximum and minimum patch dimensions in the editor to be 25 and 1.8 cm, so that the resulting resonance frequency will fall between 500MHz to 6.3GHz. This range is determined by the sensing range of our LiteVNA, the device we use to measure antenna resonance frequency. The relationship between patch size and resonance frequency is shown in Appendix A. 


        	<br><br> 

        	<b> Choosing Substrate Material Thickness<b>: The user then specifies the thickness of the substrate (dielectric). Based on the userspecified patch size and substrate thickness, the editor automatically calculates the size of the ground that minimizes fringing effects around the antenna, to be 𝑊 + 6ℎ for width and 𝐿 + 6ℎ for length, where 𝑊 is the width, 𝐿 is the length, and ℎ is the height of the Meta-antenna substrate.
        
        <br><br> 

        <b> Unit Cell Length to Width Ratio <b> : The user then inputs the length and width ratio of the unit cell as integer values. With the length & width values and previously input substrate thickness, the editor performs an automatic design check for potential unit cell  bending effects and generates design recommendations. 

        <br><br> 



<b> Specifying the Number of Units (Meta-antenna Density) <b> :
Next, the user defines the number of units, i.e. Meta-antenna density,
in the x and y axes.
        <br><br> 


<b> Loading DXF Pattern <b> : By default, the Meta-antenna design
suite uses a rectangular or square pattern for the patch shape. Users
can also load a custom DXF file for the resonating patch’s pattern.
Choosing Generated State : Next, the user selects which Meta-antenna state, from the three available, they would like
to run the simulation in.

        <br><br> 


<b> Verifying the Design Inputs <b> : The user then clicks on the
“Verify Design” check-box to see if their input is valid for a Meta- antenna geometry. If the user’s design parameters do not meet the mechanical constraints of the system, the edi-
tor suggests fixes for the geometry. The Meta-antenna editor also
calculates the expected expansion rate as seen in Figure 7-b.
        <br><br> 


Generating the Metantenna Structure: After inputting all
parameters and verifying the design, the user clicks the “Finish”
button to generate the Meta-antenna structure. Based on the gener-
ated Meta-antenna, the editor automatically picks the geometrically
optimized SMA probe (connector used to measure the antenna fre-
quency) location that is both the least lossy and geometrically valid.


        <br><br> 


Running the Simulation: Meta-antenna automatically sets
up a “return loss” simulation study for the user. To run the return
loss simulation, the user clicks the “run study” button in the Ansys
toolbar to run the simulation. Our editor then runs the study by
performing an interpolation-based sweep through frequency values
of 500MHz to 6.3 GHz with 820 points. The SMA probe is set as
the excitation port, and the ground and patch are set as perfect
electrical conductor boundaries.

        <br><br> 


Displaying Simulation Results: To display the results of the
simulation as a graph of the return loss magnitude (dB) versus
frequency (GHz), the user can click results tab -> return loss. The
user can also export this data to CSV format
        <br><br> 


Exporting Files: Finally, the user exports the generated Meta-antenna 3D model in obj format.

           META-ANTENNA FABRICATION </span>
		<br>
		<br>

		We fabricate our Meta-antennas by laser cutting the metamaterial
geometry, followed by applying conductive spray paint to form the
ground and patch layers. In this section, we highlight the steps taken
to fabricate our Meta-antenna geometries and how we prepare them
for their interactive applications.

<br> <br> 


<h5> Laser Cutting Metamaterial Geometry and
Patch Antenna Mask</h5>
     <div class="center"><img src="images/fig-masking.png" width="65%" style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-bottom:10px"/>  
            <br> <b> Figure 8: (a) Meta-antenna geometries are fabricated from
lasercut rubber sheets. (b-c) the rubber sheets are masked
with painter’s tape that is lasercut to the antenna’s patch
pattern shape. </b> </div> 
		
		<br>
        
  Fabricating Metamaterial Geometry and SMA Probe Location:
We use lasercutting as our main fabrication method. To prepare for
lasercutting, we convert the OBJ file from Ansys into a DXF file
with CAD software. We laser cut off-the-shelf laser-cuttable rubber
sheets for the main metamaterial geometry. Rubber is flexible and
durable under repeated compressions, making it ideal for our Meta-antenna base interactions (DG2). We measured the dielectric constant of our rubber material on an LCR Meter (Keysight, E49808BL)
to be 2.7 at 300kHz, which makes it suitable for our antenna frequency response. On our Universal laser cutter (PLS6.150D), we cut the rubber sheets with 100% power, 3.3% speed, and 200 PPI.
We leave the cut rubber sheet inside the laser cutter for the next
fabrication step. Besides cutting out the metamaterial geometry,
this step also cuts out a hole for the SMA probe.
		<br><br>
        
    Fabricating Antenna Masks: To create the antenna patch pattern
using conductive spray paint, we laser cut a masking layer that
covers areas not meant to be spray-painted. To accomplish this,
we cover the lasercut Meta-antenna geometry, while still inside
the laser-cutter, with painters tape. For laser cutting the mask, we
chose settings that cut the painter’s tape mask, but neither cut nor
engrave the surface of the rubber. We laser cut the painter’s tape
mask with 16% power, 100% speed, and 500 ppi. After cutting the
mask, we remove the Meta-antenna geometry from the laser cutter.    
        
        <br> <br> 


       <h5> Spraypainting Grounding Layer and Patch Antenna </h5>
<br> <br> 

Spray-painting the Grounding Layer: Next, we spray-paint the
entire bottom of the metamaterial geometry with a copper-based
conductive material using an airbrush (Master G233). We use MG-chemicals silver coated copper spray paint (843WB), which is highly conductive (5.3 × 10−4 resistivity). To ensure good coverage, we apply two layers (0.01778mm) of the spray paint, waiting 30 minutes between each layer to air dry.


     <div class="center"><img src="images/fig-spraypaint.png" width="65%" style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-bottom:10px"/>  
            <br> <b> Figure 9: Meta-antenna patches are fabricated with conductive spray paint. </b> </div> 
		
		<br>



Spray-painting the Conductive Patch Pattern: Before applying
the conductive spray paint to form the patch on top of the metamaterial geometry, we first remove the sections of masking tape covering the areas intended for conduction. We then spray-paint
the exposed regions, following the same procedure used for the
ground layer. After allowing the second conductive layer to dry for
30 minutes, we peel off the remaining masking tape from the rest
of the structure.

<br> <br> 



<h5> Coating to Improve Electrical Durability at
the Hinges </h5>

Coating the Meta-antenna: In the final step, we coat the hinges
only of the Meta-antenna top and bottom surfaces with a flexible
acrylic paint (PlaidFX Flexible Acrylic Paint) which can either be
spray-painted or directly applied via paintbrush. We found that
applying the coating improved the electrical connection durability
of the Meta-antenna at the hinges (see Section 8.4). In fact, without
applying the flexible coat, the Meta-antenna structure electrically
breaks after only one compression. Before applying the coating,
we manually mask out the region where the SMA probe connects
on the top and bottom of the geometry to maintain the electrical
connection of the SMA with the grounding and patch layers. After
coating, we let the Meta-antenna air dry for 1 hour before using it.

<br> <br> 

 <h5> Meta-antenna Assembly </h5> 
 After fabrication, we connect our Meta-antenna structure to its
supporting electronic components.
<br> <br> 
Connecting SMA Probe to MetaAntenna Geometry: We choose
a coaxial SMA probe (TAOGLAS CAB.058) that has a 50Ω impedance.
We insert the SMA probe into the corresponding hole on our Meta-antenna. To secure the SMA probe in place, we use a two-part silver conductive epoxy (MG Chemicals 8331D) and apply it to the SMA
probe location on the grounding and patch layers. We then cure the epoxy in an oven (70◦C for 15 minutes).
Connecting Antenna SMA Probe to VNA for Resonant Frequency Based Sensing: To access the antenna resonance frequency, we connect the SMA probe to a Vector Network analyzer (VNA) via an SMA cable. We use a LiteVNA, which has a range of
up to 6.3 GHz.

<br> <br> 
Connecting the Antenna-VNA to the Micro-controller: We
connect the VNA to a microprocessor to interface with the VNA through serial communication. 
This allows us to access the measured antenna return loss properties and resonance frequency (S11)
through the python skrf library for the NanoVNA. We then send
the data to our microcontroller (Arduino Uno REV3) via serial communication for further processing for interactive applications.

<br> <br> 
Tracking Changes in Meta-antenna change in state: To sup-
port users in programming Meta-antenna interactions, we provide
code templates for Python and the Arduino. Our Python code interfaces with the VNA and continuously measures for changes in the resonant frequency within a 3GHz range (500MHz-3GHz or 3GHz
to 6.3GHz). The frequency changes that meet our design goals (DG4,
DG5, Section 3) are communicated to the Arduino IDE, which then
triggers the user-designed interaction. Our Python code requires
two sets of information from the user: (1) two VNA calibration files
in the ranges of 500 MHz to 3GHz, and from 3GHz to 6.3GHz from
their VNA, (2) the start and end frequencies for the VNA to sweep,
which the simulation results provide. The VNA can reliably sweep
for a range as large as 3GHz, but becomes noisier if the range increases. Once the user specifies the range, our Python code detects the maximum resonant frequency within that range. If this value
then shifts by more than 1%—either positively or negatively— the
change is communicated as a deformation to the Arduino IDE.

		APPLICATIONS

		<br>
		<br>
  Our technique enables users to weave antennas into dynamic objects that populate their daily lives at various scales. By leveraging frequency-shift–based sensing, these antennas can power a myriad of interactive applications. In this section, we demonstrate how Meta-antennas can be used to construct responsive furniture for smart living, adaptive personal electronic devices, and interactive tangible user interfaces

Modern architecture often emphasizes creating dynamic furniture
that change shape or morph between states. Even more remarkable
is the potential for these state changes to be seamlessly detected,
making households more responsive in a smart living environment.
One example of an omnipresent and well-understood piece of furniture that undergoes shape change is the curtain. In this application, we demonstrate how Meta-antennas can transform a curtain into a
smart piece of furniture that adjusts household lighting based on
its expanded (holes) and retracted (no holes) states. By leveraging
the inherent kirigami design of our Meta-antenna, which has holes
in its expanded state and no holes in its retracted state, we map
the expanded state to dim the room lights as it allows natural light
to enter. In contrast, the retracted state, with no holes, increases
the room brightness. We constructed our metamaterial expandable curtain with a middle segment functioning as a meta-antenna
(Figure 10). The main interaction primitive we showcase in this
example is expansion/retraction. As shown in Figure 11, when the
curtain expands by 133.33%, the resonance frequency shifts by
0.194GHz (194 MHz), which is a PCRF value of 25.24% (significant, Section 3.1). This shift in frequency is detected by our VNA
and results in adjusting the LED strip’s brigthness. As illustrated
in Figure 11 (a-b), when the curtain is expanded, outside lighting enters the room, thus the LED dims out, and when the curtain is retracted (ie.no outside light enters the room), the LED turns on.

            ADAPTIVE PERSONAL ELECTRONIC DEVICES </span>

Meta-antennas can also be integrated into adaptive personal electronic devices. We demonstrate this through a smart headphone
that seamlessly transitions between noise-canceling and transparent modes, while also providing a clear physical indicator of which mode it is in. To create the smart headphone, we repurpose an existing headphone using an IRFZ44N MOSFET (transistor) to enablemode switching. In our case, the switch between modes occurs
when the central component of the headphone shown in Figure 12-a, identified as the Meta-antenna, expands and bends (interaction primitive). This expansion of 66.67% alters the resonance frequency
by 0.12 GHz (120 MHz), which is a resonance shift of 2.6% (moderate, Section 3.1). This change adjusts the transistor pin, switching the headphone mode from noise-canceling to transparent		<br><br>

            INTERACTIVE TANGIBLE USER INTERFACES </span>
		<br>
		<br>
   
        We leverage the three distinct states generated by Meta-antenna’s
rotational deformation (Section 4) to encode meaningful interactions within each of its physical configuration. In this application, we demonstrate a language learning tangible that is used as a “dynamic” flashcard for learning Chinese characters (Hanzi) and interacts with a digital interface. When learning Hanzi characters, Chinese learners memorize three sets of information: the reading of the character (Pinyin), its writing, and its meaning. This three-piece
information application is well-suited for Meta-antennas, which operate in up to three distinct states. To illustrate this, we embedded the information retaining the Hanzi character’s meaning into
State-1, its writing into State-2, and its reading (Pinyin) into State-3.
We then built a Processing UI that interfaces with the Meta-antenna
Hanzi as seen in Figure 13. The UI shows the character meaning
(State-1), the character stroke order (State-2), and the character’s
reading (State-3). As Figure 13-e) shows, the PCRF between States
(1-2) is 8% (significant) for an expansion rate of 193.33%, and the
PCRF for States (1-3) is 4% (moderate) for an expansion rate of
182.85%. The antenna is patterned with an oval patch shape that
changes pattern across states as seen in Figure 13 (b-d).

We conducted a technical evaluation to assess how close the results are between our Meta-antenna design tool’s simulation predictions and ground truth data for four meta-antenna structures. Addition ally, we compared our fabrication method against three other fabrication approaches, including multi-material 3D printing, across five
categories in fabrication and signal quality. Finally, we evaluated
the electrical durability of our hinges under reverse cyclic loading,
cyclic compression, and bending, as well as the impact of flexible
acrylic-paint coating on Meta-antenna’s resonance frequency.<br> <br>

        <br> <br> 


        Physical Testing Setup: Our experimental setup consists of
a 3D printed mounting jig to attach the DUT (Device Under Test)
antenna structures onto (Figure 14). The jig has a hole which allows
for routing the SMA cable from the DUT to the VNA, ensuring that
the SMA cable is straight. For frequency response testing, we use a
LiteVNA (Vector Network Analyzer), which has a frequency range
up to 6.3GHz.

<br> <br> 
Simulation Testing Tool: We use ANSYS HFSS for our simulations. We run a return loss study through our Meta-antenna
editor (Section 5) for frequencies from 500 MHz to 6.3 GHz. We
use the default values of electrical and magnetic properties for our
dielectric substrate from the ANSYS system library under “rubber
hard”. The output of the study is a graph of frequency as a function
of return loss magnitude (dB).

		We compare the results from our Ansys simulation tool to the
fabricated results across three different structures to evaluate our
simulation’s accuracy
<br> <br> 
        
<b>Apparatus</b>: 
        <br> We used the apparatus in Section 8.1 to measure the return loss of the fabricated samples. We constructed three structureswith Meta-antenna densities of 2x2, 4x4 and 8x8, all with a size of 71.5cm x 71.5cm- a size expected to resonate within our VNA range. Our constructed the Meta-antennas all have static solid grounds from copper tape. The static ground is to eliminate any potential mechanical deformation while collecting data for comparison. All antennas have the same SMA probe location.
<br> <br> 
        
        Procedure: We collect our frequency response data through the
VNA in two ranges: the first from 500 MHz to 3 GHz, and the second
from 3GHz to 5.3 GHz, each calibrated for that range and each with
410 data points. As for the simulation, we use the setup generated
by our editor (Section 5).

        <b> Results </b>:
        <br> We report the measured and simulated resonance frequency values (return loss) in Figure 15. As can be seen in the figure, there are some noticeable differences between the values. We report an average shift of 0.0873 GHz (𝜎 = 0.0377𝐺𝐻𝑧). These differences are due largely to differences in matching conditions,
especially the dielectric value and loss tangent of the rubber which
change based on frequency. In our lab, we could only measure the
dielectric constant up to 300 kHz, which was insufficient for the
simulation. As a result, we opted to use the default values from the
Ansys library, since measuring the dielectric constant at frequencies
higher than 300 kHz requires specialized optical equipment.

Sample Preparation: We prepared 4 samples of the same Meta-antenna structure we used in Section 8.2. The only difference is
that we fabricate three of those samples using 3D printing. The
first sample (lc-sp) is lasercut then spray-painted using our default
fabrication method. The second sample (TPU-sp) is 3D printed with TPU on an Ultimaker S5, then spray-painted with our copper-based
spray paint. The third sample (TPU-cPolyester) is multi-material
3D printed on an Ultimaker S5 with TPU and Electrifi Filament
from Multi3D (copper-based polyester) which is currently the most
conductive filament in the market. The fourth sample (TPU-cTPU)
is 3D printed in TPU and carbon-based TPU (Reprapper). Because
the carbon-based TPU filament is only available in 1.75mm diamater,
it is not compatible with Ultimaker 3D printers. As a result, for this
sample, we used a Prusa XL for multi-material 3D printing. While
all structures are identical in thickness and geometry, the TPU
filament is stiffer than the rubber sheets in our default fabrication
method. TPU has 95A shore hardness, while the rubber sheets are
at 60A. This means that TPU is more resistant to deformation.

<br> <br> 
Procedure: For VNA resonant frequency testing, we followed the
same procedure as in Section 8.2. Figure 16 shows the results.

<br> <br> 
Results: From both Table 1 and the frequency response results in
Figure 16, we see that laser cutting and spray-painting is the most
effective fabrication method for four categories out of five. Our
choice of conductor has the lowest resistivity (5.3 × 10−4 Ω · cm)
making it a superior choice as a Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) in
comparison. Our fabrication method offers the shortest fabrication
time for scaled-up applications (curtain: 2 hours 39 minutes), uses
the smallest conductor thickness (0.01778 mm), and provides an
acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with only a 0.0452 GHz
deviation from the resonant frequency in the simulation data. The
only metric where our method is not as strong is the number of
reverse cyclic compressions, which we discuss Section 8.4. The
Carbon-based TPU remains electrically stable after 10,000 reverse
compressions for a 1:1 slit-to-hinge ratio, while our method lasts
750 cycles for the same ratio.

           ELECTRICAL CONNECTIVITY ENDURANCE OF META-ANTENNA UPON CYCLIC COMPRESSION	</span>

  </div> 
        
        <br> <br> 
        <br> Apparatus: Our apparatus consists of a compressing mechanism, a
multimeter and 3 structures with a hinge:slit ratio equivalent to 2:1,
1.5:1 and 1:1 and L:W ratio (r) of 1:1. Each designed structure was
fabricated and tested 3 times. The thickness of the rubber we chose for this evaluation is 5.4mm. In all structures, the hinge width is fixed to 1.5 mm, whereas the slit is varied according to the previous
ratios. The 1.5mm hinge size is the minimum required to ensure
sufficient surface area for the conductive material to adhere to,
while also maintaining the mechanical stability of the structure to
prevent breakage. Our compressing mechanism consists of four actuators that attach to the specimen at four points. Our actuators are programmed to move forward and backward through a rack-pinion
mechanism. When all four actuators move forward-backward cyclically, the Meta-antenna goes back and forth between States 1 and 2 (Section 4). we refer to this deformation as cyclic compression.
When actuators A and D push forward, the structure compresses
to state 2, and when B and C are actuated in a pair, the structure
compresses to State-3. We refer to this deformation as reverse cyclic
loading since the structure rotates inwards then outwards (Fig. 17).


<br> <br> 
Procedure: We performed two sets of evaluations on our fabricated
metamaterial antenna, consisting of 3 samples per design across 3
designs (18 test total). The first evaluation was the reversed cyclic
compression test, and the second the cyclic compression test. In
the first test, we rotate each structure, i.e. compress it, clockwise
(actuators A and D)- then counter-clockwise (actuators B and C)
interchangeably. One cycle corresponds to a motion from the expanded state to a retracted state 
and then back to the expanded
state. After each cycle from 1-10, we check for connectivity using
a multimeter for all unit cells, then check every 5 rotations up to
100, then every 10 up to 200, 50 up to 1000, and 100 after 5000.
We repeat this for all samples. In the second test, we follow the
same procedure but the actuators move forward and backward to
compress and uncompress the structure.
        
		<br>
		<br>


		Results: Figure 18 shows the results of our experiment. We conclude that as the hinge:slit ratio increases, the Meta-antenna compresses for more cycles while still being electrically connected. For
example, a 1:2 ratio undergoes an average of 1850 reversed compression cycles, and more than 10k compression cycles in applications like the curtain and headphone designs.On the hand, 1:1.5 and 1:1
ratios have reverse compression and compression cycles averages
of (1125, 5050) and (750, 3750) respectively. This is above the commonly accepted high-cycle fatigue test value of at least 10k [16].In addition, Figure 18-d shows how much the signal varies upon
5000 cyclic compressions from 1-6 GHz for the 1:2 hinge to slit
ratio samples. The maximum standard deviation per frequency was
6.0826 db, and the minimum was 0.1810 db.

          ELECTRICAL CONNECTIVITY ENDURANCE OF META-ANTENNA UPON BENDING</span>
		<br>
		<br>

In Section 3, we discuss how Meta-antennas can be bent, which
we demonstrate through our headphone application (12). In this
section, we conduct a technical evaluation to show the bend radii
extent of our Meta-antennas and how they are influenced by Meta- antenna pattern density.

<br> <br>

<br> <br> 

Apparatus: We 3D printed 6 bend radii templates that increment
by 5mm from 5mm to 30mm (Figure 19-a). We use these templates
to bend our structures. We lasercut a Meta-antenna structure of 15
cm x 4 cm with three different unit cell densities (1x4), (2x8) and
(4x16), (x3 samples each). The thickness of the rubber is 2.3mm and
the size of the hinge is constant across all three. We then attached
each structure to a lasercut living hinge with slit separation size of
1mm. The living hinge structure is designed to curve to a 5mm bend
radius without breaking. We attach the structures to the living hinge
to ensure that as we bend, we are not introducing any additional
co-axial stretching as we are interested in evaluating pure bending.

<br> <br> 


Procedure: As seen in Figure 19-b and c, we roll each Meta-antenna structure around the radii templates starting from 30mm
bend radii to 5mm. During and after each bend operation we check
for electrical connectivity between all unit cells using a multimeter.

<br> <br> 
Results: As table 2 shows, Meta-antennas can still be electrically
connected while bent to 5mm bend radii (4x16 density pattern). We
also conclude that increasing pattern density makes the structure
more flexible. In comparison to the 4x16 pattern, the 2x8 and 1x4
patterns electrically break at 15mm and 20mm bend radii respectively. In general, higher unit cell densities introduce more holes in the structure, which make the material less rigid for bending

          EFFECT OF COATING ON RESONANT FREQUENCY
</span>
		<br>
		<br>
Next, we evaluate the effect of coating our Meta-antenna with the
flexible acrylic on its resonant frequency. The flexible acrylic is what
we use to cover the Meta-antenna hinges to make them electrically
flexible as described in Section 6.3.

<br> <br> 


Apparatus: We use the same test-set up in Section 8.1. We fabricated a square patch with dimensions 53mm x 53mm and measured
the sample at three setup intervals. To ensure we don’t report
changes due to inconsistencies in fabrication, we did not fabricate
new samples. Instead, we covered the conductive patch region of
the original sample with flexible acrylic and measured it again at
three different intervals. Additionally, we laser-cut a mask to main-
tain access to a small area around the probe for checking SMA
connectivity, as shown in Figure 20.

<br> <br> 
Procedure: We used the same procedure as Section 8.2.

<br> <br> 
Results: Figure 20-b highlights the resonant frequency for our
covered and uncovered patches. In general, the difference in the
resonance frequency between the average recorded values for the
non-coated structure and flexible acrylic-covered structure is 0.033
GHz (33 MHz). This corresponds to 0.731% PCRF, which according
to our criteria in Section 3.1 is less than 1%, and hence, insignificant
for mechanical deformation

           DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK	</span>
		<br>
		<br>
        
        In this section, we discuss the limitations of Meta-antenna and potential directions for future research.
        <br> <br> 
        
        <b> Exporting the Meta-antenna Structures: </b>
        <br> Our current Meta-antenna design tool in Ansys does not support direct export of faces or patterns into DXF files. As a result, users must first open the .obj file in a CAD program, and manually project the faces of the Meta-antenna to generate DXF files for lasercutting.

        <br> <br>

        <b>Simulation Support for Bending:</b>
        <br> We demonstrate how Meta-antennas can be used for bending; however, our tool currently does not support bending simulation. That said, users can still gain insights into the expected range of resonance frequencies through the simulation results of the same unbent structure.
        
        <br> <br> 



           <b>Cyclic Loading:</b>
        <br> We demonstrated the electrical durability of the Meta-antenna under cyclic loading for a structure with square (1:1 ratio of L:W) unit cells. We consider the square unit cell to represent a lower bound for our Meta-antenna performance. Increasing the length-to-width ratio beyond 1:1, while still adhering to our mechanical constraints (Appendix A) will make the structure bend more easily, leading to more cycles before failure.
        
        <br> <br> 
        
        
        


                  <b>3D deployment:</b> 
        <br> Our current Meta-antenna implementation generates planar structures that compress/expand, rotate, and bend. In future implementations, we would like to further construct 3D structures that change size radially and axially. We have preliminarily demonstrated this by fabricating a 3D-printed auxetic cylinder structure that is printed in one pass using TPU, then spray-painted with conductive copper paint (Figure 21-a).
        
        <br> <br> 


                  <b>Bistable Structures:</b>
        <br> In this paper, we fabricated Meta-antennas as monostable structures capable of deforming into three distinct states. However, in the future, we would like our Meta-antennas to also be bistable structures that can retain their configurations without requiring a force to sustain them in place. We demonstrated this by constructing a bistable antenna that expands and retracts radially (Figure 21-b).
        
        <br> <br> 


                  <b>Extending Meta-antenna to Other Symmetric Patterns:</b>
        <br> In this project, we demonstrated Meta-antenna's working principle for rotating grid structures that are rectangular. However, our design space supports other wallpaper symmetric groups \cite{wallpapergroups2019}. We show a sample of the other symmetric wallpaper patterns that belong to Meta-antenna's design space in Figure 21-c.
        
        <br> <br> 

                                 <div class="center"><img src="images/future-works.png" width="45%" style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-bottom:10px"/>  
            <br> <b> Figure 21. The Meta-antenna design space can be extended to (a) 3D metamaterial structures, (b) bistable metamaterials and (c) other symmetric auxetic metamaterial groups. </b></div> 
        
       <br> <br> <br> 


                  <b>Continuous Sensing and State Recognition:</b> 
        <br> Based on our
observations, and motivated by literature on antennas of the same
geometry [37], Meta-antenna expansion causes the frequency to
linearly decrease due to the increase in the antenna’s effective
length. Similarly, for bending, the bend direction and its effect
on the effective length also dictate how the resonance frequency
changes. For example, [21 ][ 2] show bending increases frequency,
while [45] shows a decrease. In future work, we would like to
implement continuous sensing and state recognition using ML for
Meta-antenna. With our custom patch pattern design, the linear
function coefficients of the antenna to be stretched incrementally
can be more complicated, which can be combined with machine
learning with an ML regression model.
        
        <br> <br> 





                     <b>Effect of Direct Human Touch:</b>
        <br> During our experiments, we observed that direct contact with human touch affects the resonant frequency of Meta-antenna structures. However, when the human body is in close proximity to the Meta-antenna, yet no direct contact is established, there were no observed changes in the resonance frequency, but slight fluctuations in the return loss db value (SNR). To mitigate the effect of human touch, we can use coating, shielding or air gap structures, which we used for the Hanzi application.

        
        <br> <br> 


                     <b>Backscatter:</b>
        <br> We demonstrated Meta-antenna with sensing-based interactive applications. Although not demonstrated in this paper, it is possible to implement other interaction modalities, like backscatter, with Meta-antenna by connecting a 50 $\Omega$ load to the Meta-antenna, then connect another antenna to the VNA. The VNA generates a wave and measures how much is reflected back due to Meta-antenna (S11 value). As the Meta-antenna deforms, the other antenna’s S11 value shifts. Backscatter enables wireless power through impedance matching the load to the Meta-antenna via complex conjugates.
        <br> <br> 


                     <b> Shielding and Environmental RF:</b>
        <br> While not implemented and much observed due to using Meta-antenna for sensing, it is possible to mitigate environmental RF noise through proper electromagnetic shielding or more advanced filtering techniques with reasonable compromise over RF communication quality. These methods help isolate unwanted signals, as recommended by literature [13]. 
        
        <br> <br> 

                             <b> Integration with HCI Metamaterial Concepts:</b>
        <br> Metantenna relies on surface patterning of conductive material on morphing geometry that change the antenna's effectie length, hence inducing change in the antenna's resonance frequency. This makes Meta-antenna compatible with other Metamaterial concepts in HCI like Metasense \cite{metasense2021}** and Mechanical Metamaterials \cite{ion2016metamaterial}**.

           CONCLUSION		</span>
		<br>
		<br>
        


        In this paper, we presented Meta-antenna, a design and fabrication pipeline for creating frequency-reconfigurable antennas using a single type of mechanical metamaterial structure that can transition between three distinct geometric and frequency states. Our approach offers a straightforward method for creating mechanically reconfigurable antennas with metamaterials, and our technical evaluation shows that our fabrication method produces antennas that radiate efficiently while remaining mechanically and electrically stable after multiple deformations. Through our applications, we demonstrated how Meta-antennas can be integrated into various dynamic objects and across different scales. These applications range from responsive furniture for smart living to adaptive personal electronic devices and interactive tangible user interfaces. Our Ansys-based design tool allows users to design and simulate Meta-antenna structures, while our interaction code template enables user interaction through frequency-shift sensing. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining metamaterials and antennas in a hybridly functional way, paving the way for more means to weave antennas into the fabric of our daily lives. Just as our Meta-antenna serves as both a metamaterial and an antenna, we hope our work inspires further exploration of alternative geometries for antennas and hybridly functional structures.
