		<b>Towards More Personal Health Sensing</b>
		</h3>
		<br>
		With the development of low-cost electronics, rapid prototyping techniques, as well as widely available mobile devices (e.g. mobile phones, smart watches), projects related to the design and fabrication of personal health sensing applications, either on top of existing device platforms (e.g. mHealth), or as stand-alone devices, have emerged in the last decade. In addition, recent advances in novel sensing and interface technologies, accessibility studies and system design open up new possibilities and can bring in different perspectives for personal health sensing. We believe that joining the forces in such interdisciplinary work is a key to moving the field of personal health sensing forward. This Special Interest Group aims to bring in researchers from different fields, identify the significance and challenges of the personal health sensing domain, discuss potential solutions and future research directions, and promote collaborative research opportunities.

		<span class="medium-headline">
		BACKGROUND
		</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		With the development of low-cost electronics, rapid prototyping techniques, as well as widely available mobile devices (e.g. mobile phones, smart watches), projects related to the design and fabrication of personal health sensing devices and applications have emerged in the last decade. These projects are usually either built on top of existing device platforms, such as mobile phones (e.g. HemaApp [20], Seismo [21]) and smart watches (e.g. Ravichandran et al. [17]), or as stand-alone devices (e.g. Glabella [7], DoppleSleep [16], EIT-kit [23]). Recently, with the assistance of interactive device prototyping tools, such as CurveBoards [22], SqueezaPulse [6] and MorphSensor [24], as well as widely available personal fabrication machines [1], users with limited electronics knowledge can also design and fabricate customized health sensing devices, which opens up opportunities for the field of personal health sensing.
		<br>
		<br>
		However, there are more interdisciplinary research topics that can be applied to personal health sensing. For example, works about novel sensing and interface technologies increase the design space and provide novel sensing techniques that can be integrated into personal health sensing devices, such as kinesthetic sensing (bioSync [14], Kasahara et al. [12]), smell sensing (Brooks et al. [3]) skin interfaces (SkinMorph [9], SkinWire [10]), and even some unconventional on-body interfaces like fingernail interfaces (NailO [11]). In addition, well-evaluated accessibility studies, like accessibility for blind and low vision people [13, 15], as well as for d/Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people [5, 8], can be considered as design guidelines for future personal health sensing devices.
		<br>
		<br>
		Another perspective that is often overlooked is the design of personal health sensing devices. Apart from the "functional" aspect of the device design, such as customizing the shape for ensuring constant contact to the measured area [2], and altering measuring locations for capturing better biomedical signals [19], the form factors and appearance of the device also have impacts over user’s self-esteem and even mental health [18]. Like other everyday personal belongings, personal health sensing devices design should consider user’s artistic needs and the effects on the user’s mental state. Instead of being rigid and box-like, they can also be unobtrusive, or be part of the user’s personal decoration and social expression.
		<br>
		<br>
		In this SIG, we will be discovering these potential research spaces, and building an interdisciplinary network of researchers to bring solutions and new perspectives into the personal health sensing domain. We will use this SIG as a platform to learn about each other’s work — the challenges, tools and techniques being used, and discuss if and how they can be applied to personal health sensing. We believe that joining the forces in such interdisciplinary work is a key to moving the field of personal health sensing forward.
		<br>
		<br>

		<span class="medium-headline">
		AIMS AND GOALS
		</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		In this SIG about personal health sensing, we aim to: <br><br>
		<ul>
			<li> define the term personal health sensing and discuss how it relates to (and differentiates from) traditional health sensing and other research disciplines in HCI; </li>
			
			<li>identify the core aspects of personal health sensing and define the open challenges / opportunities, such as the device form factors, personalized sensing interfaces, acquisition of ground truth data, clinical trials, device feedback that respects a user’s intention / voluntary, user privacy, applicable novel sensing and fabrication technologies etc.; </li>

			<li>vote for the top identified opening challenges with participants and collaboratively brainstorm solutions; </li>
			
			<li>summarize potential future research directions in personal health sensing and promote collaborative research opportunities. </li>
			
		</ul>
		<br>
		This process will involve open discussions with attendees. During the session, we will ask attendees to share their own diverse backgrounds, experiences, and opinions to get a broad picture of what personal health sensing means to the community. We will then hold small group discussions to identify the core challenges of personal heath sensing and brainstorm solutions, which will then be shared with the entire audience. We will vote on the most important challenges identified in the small group discussions through online voting platforms (e.g. Slido [4]), so that attendees can participate both physically and virtually with their preferred devices. We hope to compose a summary of this SIG and submit it to a future CHI conference as a workshop or a journal position paper to reach the broader community and create further engagement. We are welcoming both experienced health sensing related researchers and new-comers to participant this SIG.

		ORGANIZING TEAM AND ATTENDEES
		</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		This SIG is targeted at researchers that work in fields related to personal health sensing, and those who have general interests in the topics. To align the composition of the organizing team with the goals of the SIG and attract researchers from related fields, the main organizers Junyi Zhu and Stefanie Mueller have already reached out to researchers of related disciplines and invited them to join the SIG organization, such as Edward Wang from the health sensing domain, Liang He from personal fabrication, Hamid Ghaednia from the medical field, Jun Nishida from sensing and interface technologies, Hsin-Liu (Cindy) Kao with design expertise, as well as Jon Froehlich who focuses on accessibility studies. The organizers will act as "hosts" for their respective fields, i.e. they will provide an overview of research from their discipline and how it relates to personal health sensing. In addition, they will help to distribute this SIG among their disciplines to attract participants, as well as connect HCI researchers with potential collaborators in their field.
		<br>
		<br>
		The SIG will be held under the hybrid format to enable both physical and virtual attendees to join. However, all participants are encouraged to attend physically when possible for the most interactive experience. Our SIG welcomes both experienced health sensing researchers who wish to develop the field further, and new-comers looking to get a taste for the field.
		<br>
		<br>

		<span class="medium-headline">
		SIG MEETING AGENDA
		</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		The SIG will be held under the hybrid format in which attendees can participate both physically and remotely. For remotely-attending participants, we will have a Zoom link that streams the SIG in real time. Remote participants will also be assigned to breakout rooms for small group discussion sessions. For selecting the core aspects and most significant challenges, remote participants can use the online voting system in the same way as the physical attendees on their own devices.
		<br>
		<br>
		We propose the following 75-minute agenda: <br><br>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Introduction:</b> We will begin with an overview of personal health sensing, rapid 1-minute introductions of the co-organizers and their work related to personal health sensing, and an ice-breaker activity. (15 minutes) </li>
			
			<li><b>Small Group Brainstorm (core aspects & challenges):</b> We will then break into small groups to brainstorm and discuss the core aspects and challenges in the area of personal health sensing. Each group will be seeded with a separate list of initial ideas (i.e. the ones mentioned in Section 2) to ensure topic coverage. (15 minutes) </li>

			<li><b>Present & Discuss:</b> Each group will present its results to the entire SIG and lead a small discussion. We will take notes of the identified challenges, and set up an online voting system for all participants to select the most significant ones. (15 minutes) </li>
			
			<li><b>Small Group Brainstorm (solutions & opportunities):</b> Once all groups have presented and voting has closed, attendees will focus on the top ∼5 key challenges and again split into small groups (same groups as previous brainstorm session) to discuss solutions and potential opportunities. We will provide a Google Docs / Slides for each group to document the discussion. (15 minutes) </li>

			<li><b>Closing Discussion:</b> We will reconvene as the entire SIG and review potential solutions and key future research topics in the field of personal health sensing as identified in the small group discussions. Organizers will provide access to a Slack group for further discussion. (15 minutes) </li>
			
		</ul>
		<br>

		EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND NEXT STEPS
		</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		We expect this SIG to influence and establish future research directions in the area of personal health sensing. We hope to bring in researchers from different fields, form connections across disciplines, explore new perspectives of each other’s field, and promote collaborative research opportunities. We will compose a summary of this SIG and submit it to a future CHI conference as a workshop or a journal position paper to reach the broader community and further engagement.
